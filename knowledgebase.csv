sport,"A large sport utility vehicle such as the Toyota Land Cruiser is used (however, light weight vehicles often fare better in the extremely soft sand found on sand dunes)[citation needed]."
racing,Off-road racing[edit] Main article: Off-road racing Desert racing[edit] High-speed racing in the open desert includes chases and racing on a rough desert terrain with numerous pots and bumps at the maximum speed.
racing,"[1] Rock racing[edit] Rock Racing is very similar to rock crawling in the fact that the vehicles are driven over rocks, the difference is that there are no penalties for hitting cones, backing up or winching as is done in rock crawling."
racing,Rock racing also involves a degree of high-speed racing not seen in typical rock crawling.
road,"As the name suggests, it is for vehicles that are road-legal (and thus required to pay road tax)."
standard,"Vehicles on RTV trials are usually best described as ""modified from standard""—they use the standard chassis, drive-train and body that the vehicle was built with."
standard,The gates are just wide enough to get a standard vehicle through.
standard,"Since the terrain covered in RTV trials should be well within the capabilities of any reasonably capable vehicle (even in standard form), these trials place the emphasis on driver skill and ground-reading abilities."
standard,"A good driver in a standard specification vehicle can easily win over a modified, highly equipped vehicle driven by a less competent driver."
engine,"For many years, in the UK, the ultimate CCV vehicle could be built by taking the chassis of a Range Rover, removing the body, cutting the chassis down to an 80-inch wheelbase and mating it to the body of a Series I Land Rover, retaining the Range Rover's V8 engine and coil-spring suspension in a light, easy to maneuvre body."
standard,CCV triallers now usually base their vehicles around Land Rover 90s or a standard 100-inch chassis from a Range Rover or Series I Discovery.
sport,"""Tyro"" trialing is intended as an introduction to the sport for newcomers or children and is the most basic level of trialing."
road,[citation needed] off road parks and motocross tracks also host a number of events and may be the only legal place to off-road in the area.
racing,"Events include jamborees, rock crawling competitions, Mud Bog races, Top Truck Challenges and sand racing as well as many other events, such as the Tank Trap."
road,It is popular Ultra4 off road racing series with races such as King of the Hammers.
racing,Those Ultra4 cars combine desert racing and rock crawling in one car.
road,"Traction[edit] Off-roading is always related to driving off the pavement, making it important to maintain proper traction in all road conditions such as mud, dirt, rocks, sand, ice or snow."
road,Continuous track is often used in extreme road conditions when regular wheels can't provide enough traction for moving forward.
road,Large overall wheel diameter provides a better ride comfort and road clearance.
road,Each tire type has its own tread type to provide a proper grip in certain road conditions.
road,"In the United States, bumper and frame height laws are effective in most states to ensure that the vehicles on the road are not too much higher than their average car counterparts."
engine,"A typical solution would be to install skid plates (sometimes also called bash plates), which are thick metal plates protecting vulnerable parts (such as the transfer/gear box or engine oil sump)."
standard,Some manufacturers install skid plates as standard equipment on some of their vehicles.
engine,"This is because ""two-stroke engines emit about 20 to 33 percent of the consumed fuel through the exhaust"" (as the engine lubricant is a ""total loss system"" and is emitted by design) and ""discharge from two-stroke snowmobile engines can lead to indirect pollutant deposition into the top layer of snow and subsequently into the associated surface and ground water""."
road,"In 2009, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled against the BLM's proposed designation of additional off road use on designated open routes on public land."
road,[29] These campaigns in part have prompted congressional hearings about the growing impact of unmanaged off road vehicle use.

engine,"[3][4] According to Douglas Harper, the Swedish terms originated from ""(trampcykel med) mo(tor och) ped(aler)"", which means ""pedal cycle with engine and pedals"" (the earliest versions had auxiliary pedals)."
engine,"The term moped has now been applied by some regional governments to vehicles without pedals such as motor scooters, based on criteria of restricted engine displacement, speed, and/or power output."
engine,"Better transmissions with wider ranges, better clutches and much better engine performance made pedals obsolete on most motorcycles by 1918 but the pedals on mopeds remained valuable for their original purposes as late as the 1990s."
engine,"Slightly larger machines, commonly with a 98 cc (6.0 cu in) engine were known as autocycles."
road,"In 1977, the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic considers the moped any two-wheeled or three-wheeled vehicle which is fitted with an internal combustion engine having a cylinder capacity not exceeding 50 cc."

engine,"Mopeds are often illegally tuned for higher speeds, powers or engine displacements than allowed."
motorcycle,"To ride a scooter over 50cc you need a motorcycle licence in all states, but you can ride a scooter (max 50cc, 50 km/h) with a car licence in QLD[19] and SA[20] and with a moped specific licence in WA[21] otherwise a general motorcycle licence is required."

motorcycle,Rally[edit] Main article: Motorcycle rally A road rally is a navigation event on public roads whereby competitors must visit a number of checkpoints in diverse geographical locations while still obeying road traffic laws (not to be confused with car rallies such as WRC).
motorcycle,Speedway[edit] Main article: Motorcycle speedway Speedway is a motorcycle sport in which the motorcycles have one gear and no brakes.
motorcycle,Other Motorcycle sports[edit] Land speed[edit] Main article: Motorcycle land speed record Land speed is where a single rider accelerates over a 1 to 3-mile (4.8 km) long straight track (usually on dry lake beds) and is timed for top speed through a trap at the end of the run.
racing,This activity evolved from Motocross a continuing popular form of racing at both the Amateur and Professional levels.
motorcycle,"Trials[edit] Main article: Motorcycle trials Trials commonly take place on rocky terrain Known in the US as Observed Trials, it is not racing, but a sport nevertheless."
motorcycle,"Trials is a test of skill on a motorcycle whereby the rider attempts to traverse an observed section without placing a foot on the ground (and traditionally, although not always, without ceasing forward motion)."
standard,"The person who completes the route the quickest sets the ""standard time"" and all other competitors must finish within a certain amount of time of the standard time to be counted as a finisher (they received penalty points for every minute after the quickest finisher)."
motorcycle,"Motorcycle Gymkhana[edit] Main article: Gymkhana (motorcycle) Similar to car Autocross, Motorcycle Gymkhana is a motorcycle time trial sport round cones on a paved area."
motorcycle,Motorcycle Polo first began as an officially organized sport in the mid-1930s.
sport,"[1] In France, there are organized motoball competitions, and the sport was included in the inaugural Goodwill Games."
motorcycle,"The motorcycle of choice in the early decades was the Harley-Davidson 45 cubic inch model due to its high torque at low rpms, similar to farm engines."
road,"[2] In other countries, notably the United Kingdom, completions mostly take place on tarmac courses, occasionally closed public roads, with the machines used for competition being similar to those used for other road disciplines."

motorcycle,[1] The US Department of Transportation defines a scooter as a motorcycle that has a platform for the operator's feet or has integrated footrests and has a step-through architecture.
engine,"Unlike a conventional motorcycle, in which the engine is mounted on the frame, most modern scooters allow the engine to swing with the rear wheel, while most vintage scooters and some newer retro models have an axle-mounted engine."
engine,Scooters have varying engine displacements and configurations ranging from 50 cc single-cylinder to 850 cc twin-cylinder models.
motorcycle,"Traditionally, scooter wheels are smaller than conventional motorcycle wheels and are made of pressed steel or cast aluminum alloy, bolt on easily, and often are interchangeable between front and rear."
engine,"Though some jurisdictions classify smaller engine scooters (typically 50cc maximum) as moped class vehicles rather than motorcycles, meaning these scooters often have less stringent regulations (for example, 50cc scooters can be driven with a normal car drivers license in many jurisdictions, and might pay less road-tax and be subject to less stringent roadworthiness testing)."
motorcycle,"For all legal purposes in the United States of America, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recommends using the term motorcycle for all of these vehicles."
motorcycle,"It classifies vehicles with fewer than four wheels into the following categories:[4] Motorcycle: a motorcycle is any 2- or 3-wheeled gas operated vehicle weighing under 1,500 lbs."
engine,with an engine displacement greater than or equal to 150ccs.
motorcycle,"Operation requires an M1 class license, and such vehicles must be registered with the state and carry mandatory insurance as well as bear a motorcycle license plate."
engine,Motor-driven cycle: a motor-driven cycle is 2-wheeled gas operated vehicle with an engine displacement of 149ccs or less that does not qualify as a moped (see below) and is capable of traveling greater than 30 mph.
engine,"Moped: a moped (or ""motorized bicycle"") is a 2- or 3-wheeled device with an automatic transmission capable of traveling no more than 30 mph, with either a gas engine displacement of less than 50ccs (i.e., 49ccs or less) with built-in pedals like a bicycle for human operation, OR, if powered only by electricity, it must not produce more than four gross brake horsepower (bicycle pedals are optional for electric mopeds)."
engine,"A class 1 electric bicycle is a bicycle with pedals whose electric motor only provides assistance to the rider when using the pedals and stops assisting when the bicycle reaches 20 mph; a class 2 electric bicycle is a bicycle with pedals whose motor can drive the bicycle entirely on its own, but will not assist the rider above 20 mph; a class 3 electric bicycle is identical to a class 1 electric bicycle, but is capable of traveling up 28 mph before the engine stops assisting the rider AND is equipped with a speedometer."
engine,"In 2011[update] the United States Environmental Protection Agency allowed motorcycles, scooters, and mopeds with engine displacements less than 280 cc to emit ten times the NOx and six times the CO than the median Tier II bin 5 automobile regulations."
engine,"[9] In Genoa, the home of the Vespa scooter, 2-stroke engine scooters made before 1999 are banned since 2019."
motorcycle,[11][12] History[edit] Predecessors[edit] Scooter-like traits began to develop in motorcycle designs around the 1900s.
motorcycle,"In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller in Munich, Germany produced the first motorcycle that was available for purchase."
motorcycle,"Their motorcycle had a step-through frame, with its fuel tank mounted on the down tube, its parallel two-cylinder engine mounted low on the frame, and its cylinders mounted in line with the frame."
engine,"It became the first mass-produced and publicly sold powered two-wheel vehicle, and among the first powered mainly by its engine rather than foot pedals."
motorcycle,This was basically a step-through motorcycle with an armchair instead of a traditional saddle.
motorcycle,"[14] Predecessors to the scooter 1894 Hildebrand & Wolfmüller motorcycle 1908 French Auto-Fauteuil motorcycle First generation (1915–1930)[edit] The Motoped entered production in 1915, and is believed to be the first motor scooter."
engine,"[15] They were followed that year by the Autoped, whose engine was engaged by pushing the handlebar column forward and whose brake was engaged by pulling the column back."
engine,[28] Cushman was an engine manufacturer that started making scooters after Salsbury found their offer to supply engines to be unacceptable.
engine,[32] Small numbers of the 165 cc (10.1 cu in) Harley-Davidson Topper scooter were produced from 1960 to 1965 using the engine from their line of light motorcycles based on the DKW RT 125.
standard,"[36] Second generation scooters, Japan, 1946–1968 Fuji Rabbit Touring 150 (S-402) Mitsubishi Silver Pigeon Third generation (1946–1964) and beyond[edit] Italy - Vespa and Lambretta[edit] 1952 Lambretta 125 D In post-World War II Italy the Piaggio Vespa became the standard for scooters, and has remained so for over 60 years."
engine,"The engine was placed near the rear wheel, eliminating the belt drive."
road,The body design protected the driver from wind and road dirt.
engine,It had a top speed of 45 mph (72 km/h) from a fan-cooled engine of 123 cc (7.5 cu in).
engine,"The first Lambretta designs had shaft drive and no rear suspension, later designs used various drive and suspension systems until Lambretta settled on a swingarm-mounted engine with chain drive."
motorcycle,[48] Several manufacturers in the German motorcycle industry made scooters.
engine,"It was in production for about ten years, in three engine sizes, 150 cc (9.2 cu in), 175 cc (10.7 cu in) and 200 cc (12 cu in)."
engine,"The Maicoletta had a choice of engine sizes, approximately 175 cc (10.7 cu in), 250 cc (15 cu in), or 275 cc (16.8 cu in), The tubular frame was built on motorcycle principles, with long-travel telescopic forks and 14-inch (356 mm) wheels."
motorcycle,"Other German scooters made by motorcycle manufacturers included the DKW Hobby, the Dürkopp Diana, and the TWN Contessa."
engine,The Tigress was made from 1959 to 1964 and was sold with a 175 cc 2-stroke single engine or a 250 cc 4-stroke twin;[50] both versions used a foot-operated four-speed gearbox.
honda,"Indian scooters Bajaj Chetak LML Stella East Asia[edit] Since the 1980s Japan, and latterly China and Taiwan, have become world leaders in the mass production of plastic bodied scooters,[56] a popular early model being the Honda Spree/Nifty Fifty."
engine,"[58] Both 2-stroke and 4-stroke plastic bodied scooters have been mass-produced in East Asia, with engine and transmission designs being either local designs or license built versions of European engines (eg Minarelli or Morini)."
engine,"A popular 4-stroke engine in Chinese production is the GY6 engine, but electric motor-scooters are constantly increasing in the Chinese home market share."
honda,"East Asian plastic bodied scooters Honda Spree/Nifty Fifty (Japan) Honda Lead (Japan) Suzuki SJ50QT made for Suzuki by the Chinese Jincheng Group[59] Yamaha Jog (Japan) Flyscooters Il Bello (China) Kymco Super 9 (Taiwan) Developments[edit] Trends around the world have seen new developments of the classic scooter, some with larger engines and tires."
motorcycle,"Unlike most motorcycle trikes, it is a reverse trike, with two front wheels which steer, and a single driven rear wheel."
honda,"Maxi-scooter[edit] Honda CN250 Helix A maxi-scooter[64] or touring scooter[65] is a large scooter, with engines ranging in size from 150 to 850 cc (9.2 to 51.9 cu in), and using larger frames than normal scooters with longer wheelbases."
honda,"Typically, the dash is fixed & is not mounted on the handlebars The trend toward maxi-scooters began in 1986 when Honda introduced the CN250 Helix / Fusion / Spazio."
honda,"[66] Honda (600 cc or 37 cu in), Aprilia/Gilera (839 cc or 51.2 cu in), Yamaha (530 cc or 32 cu in), Kymco (700 cc or 43 cu in) and others have also introduced scooters with engine displacements ranging from 400 to 850 cc (24 to 52 cu in)."
engine,A new direction in maxi-scooters has the engine fixed to the frame.
motorcycle,"The trend toward larger, more powerful scooters with fully automatic transmissions converges with an emerging trend in motorcycle design that foreshadows automatic transmission motorcycles with on-board storage."
motorcycle,"Examples include the Aprilia Mana 850 automatic-transmission motorcycle and the Honda NC700D Integra, which is a scooter built on a motorcycle platform."
motorcycle,"Enclosed scooter[edit] Main article: Cabin motorcycle Some scooters, including the BMW C1 and the Honda Gyro Canopy, have a windscreen and a roof."
standard,The SR50 has a listed fuel consumption of 2 litres per 100 kilometres (120 mpg‑US)[citation needed] and meets the Euro 3 standard with a two-stroke engine.
honda,"Some examples are: the ENV from Intelligent Energy, Honda's scooter using the Honda FC Stack, and the Yamaha FC-AQEL."
motorcycle,An underbone is a motorcycle built on a chassis consisting mostly of a single large diameter tube.
motorcycle,An underbone differs from a conventional motorcycle mainly by not having a structural member connecting the head stock to the structure under the front of the seat and by not having a fuel tank or similarly styled appendage in the space between the riders knees.
engine,"The engine of an underbone is usually fixed to the chassis under the downtube, while a scooter usually has its engine mounted on its swingarm."
engine,"Furthermore, having an engine mounted on the swingarm gives a typical scooter more unsprung mass than a typical underbone."
engine,The engine of an underbone typically drives the rear wheel by a chain of the kind used on a conventional motorcycle.
engine,The final drive of a scooter with a swingarm-mounted engine runs in a sealed oil bath and is shorter.
motorcycle,"An underbone is usually fitted with near full-size motorcycle wheels, which are often spoked."
engine,"While the engine and suspension layouts described here for scooters and underbones are typical, they are not rigid definitions."
engine,"A twenty-first century example of variance from the typical scooter layout is the Suzuki Choinori, which had both its engine and its rear axle rigidly bolted to its frame."
engine,This scooter had a frame-mounted engine and a swingarm with an integral chain enclosure.
honda,1980 Honda NC50.
engine,This underbone had its engine mounted on its swingarm.
engine,Both its engine and its rear axle are bolted to its frame.
road,"[citation needed] Motor scooter parking lot In Taiwan, road infrastructure has been built specifically with two wheelers in mind, with separate lanes and intersection turn boxes."
road,"In many localities, certain road motor scooters are considered by law to be in the same class as mopeds or small motorcycles and therefore they have fewer restrictions than do larger motorcycles."
motorcycle,"[citation needed] According to the Motorcycle Industry Council, sales of motor scooters in the United States have more than doubled since 2000."
motorcycle,The motorcycle industry as a whole has seen 13 years of consecutive growth.
engine,Engine side panels and front bumpers were taken to local electroplating workshops and plated with highly reflective chrome.

sport,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Sportbike) Jump to navigation Jump to search Main article: Types of motorcycles A Kawasaki sport bike at a track day at Lakeside International Raceway."
motorcycle,"A sportbike, or sports bike, is a motorcycle optimized for speed, acceleration, braking, and cornering on paved roads, typically at the expense of comfort and fuel economy by comparison with other motorcycles."
honda,"[1] Soichiro Honda wrote in the owner's manual of the 1959 Honda CB92 Benly Super Sport that, ""Primarily, essentials of the motorcycle consists in the speed and the thrill,"" while Cycle World's Kevin Cameron says that, ""A sportbike is a motorcycle whose enjoyment consists mainly from its ability to perform on all types of paved highway – its cornering ability, its handling, its thrilling acceleration and braking power, even (dare I say it?)"
honda,[4] The introduction of the Honda CB750 in 1969 marked a dramatic increase in the power and speed of practical and affordable sport bikes available to the general public.
honda,[5] The groundbreaking inline four of the Honda CB750.This was followed in the 1970s by improvements in suspension and braking commensurate with the power of the large inline fours that had begun to dominate the sport bike world.
sport,"In the 1980s sport bikes again took a leap ahead, becoming almost indistinguishable from racing motorcycles."
sport,"[6] Since the 1990s sport bikes have become more diverse, adding new variations like the naked bike and streetfighter to the more familiar road racing style of sport bike."
yamaha,[4][7][8] Contents 1 Design elements 2 Classes 2.1 Variations 3 See also 4 References Design elements[edit] Dual front disc brakes with four piston radial calipers on a Yamaha YZF-R6.
sport,Aftermarket upgrades using carbon fiber or other exotic materials are used on sport bikes to enhance the power-to-weight ratio and handling.
sport,"With the emphasis of a sport bike being on speed, acceleration, braking, and maneuverability, there are certain design elements that most motorcycles of this type will share."
sport,[3][9] Sport bikes have comparatively high-performance engines resting inside a lightweight frame.
sport,[9] High tech and expensive materials are often used on sport bikes to reduce weight.
sport,"Fairings may or may not be used on a sport bike; when used, fairings are shaped to reduce aerodynamic drag as much as possible and provide wind protection for the rider."
engine,"[9] The combination of rider position, location of the engine and other heavy components, and the motorcycle's geometry help maintain structural integrity and chassis rigidity, and determine how it will behave under acceleration, braking, and cornering."
sport,"Correct front-to-rear weight distribution is of particular importance to the handling of sport bikes, and the changing position of the rider's body dynamically changes the handling of the motorcycle."
road,"[10] Generally, road racing style sport bikes have shorter wheelbases than those intended for more comfortable touring, and the current trend in sport bike design is towards shorter wheelbases, giving quicker turning at the expense of a greater tendency for unintentional wheelies and stoppies under hard acceleration and braking, respectively."
sport,[13] Classes[edit] There is no universal authority defining the terminology of sport bikes or any other motorcycle classes.
sport,"Nonetheless, by present day standards in Europe, North America and the rest of the developed world, sport bikes are usually divided into three, four, or five rough categories, reflecting vaguely similar engine displacement, horsepower, price and intended use, with a good measure of subjective opinion and simplification."
motorcycle,"Sometimes the classes used in motorcycle racing are approximated in production models, often but not always in connection with homologation."
sport,"The sport bike classes in common usage are:[7][14][15] Lightweight, also called entry level, small or beginner bikes."
sport,[7] Sport bikes with engine displacements of up to about 500 cc (31 cu in) are usually in this class.
racing,"[7] Some of the models in this range qualify for racing in the classes AMA Supersport Championship, British Supersport Championship and the Supersport World Championship, but many middleweights do not have a significant presence in racing."
sport,"[20] Alternatively, these terms mark a class above the superbikes for the largest displacement sport bikes with the highest top speeds, with weights somewhat greater than the superbike class."
sport,[22] The Kawasaki Ninja 250R lightweight sport bike.
yamaha,A Yamaha YZF-R1 998 cc (60.9 cu in) superbike.
engine,"[23] Categorization by engine displacement alone is a crude measure, particularly when comparing engines with different numbers of cylinders like inline or V fours with parallel and V twins, not to mention the greater power for a given displacement of two-stroke engines over four strokes."
engine,"[8] In the less developed world, smaller engine sizes are the norm, and relative terms like small, mid-sized and large displacement can have different meanings."
honda,"[26] When the original superbike,[27][28] the Honda CB750, appeared in 1969, it was called a ""big four,""[4] while today an inline four of 736.5 cc (44.94 cu in) would be classed in the middle range."
sport,"Besides having product lines that span from entry level through high end sport bikes, many manufacturers add depth[29] to that line by having pairs, or several pairs, of similar sport bikes aimed at riders of different levels."
racing,"The more expensive model will be in the vein of a race replica, offering the latest technology updated with frequent design revisions, while the lower cost model typically relies on older technology, can have a more relaxed riding position, and is generally more practical for non-road racing tasks such as urban commuting and carrying passengers or baggage, and offering lower fuel, insurance and maintenance costs."
sport,"Sport touring motorcycles share many features of sport bikes, but they are generally considered a class all their own."
sport,"These are mid- to large-sized motorcycles that offer more carrying capacity, more relaxed ergonomics, and more versatility than specialized sport bikes, while being lighter and more agile than touring motorcycles."
sport,"[30] Some sport bikes are marketed as race replicas, implying that the model sold to the public is identical to the one used in racing, or at least is closer to the racing version than non-replica models."
yamaha,"[31][32][33] In 1982 Yamaha described their 1983 RD350 YPVS launched at the Cologne motorcycle show as ""the nearest thing to a road going racer ever produced""."
sport,"[34] The term race replica was then also used to distinguish the period of sport bike production from Japan and Europe since the mid-1980s having integrated race-styled bodywork, representing an evolution from the superbike period that began in 1969."
sport,"[35] The sport bike, or race replica, era began with the 1983 Suzuki RG250 Gamma, the 1984 Honda VF750F and the 1985 Suzuki GSX-R750, and had full fairings."
sport,[36][37] Sport bikes with small or no fairings have proliferated since the mid-1990s.
sport,"These are called naked bikes or streetfighters,[7][38] and they retain many of the performance features of other sport bikes, but besides abbreviated bodywork, they give the rider a more upright posture by using, for example, higher handlebars instead of clip ons."
motorcycle,"The streetfighter name, associated with motorcycle stunt riding and perhaps hooliganism on public roads, can imply higher performance than the sometimes more tame naked bike, which in some cases is a synonym for a standard motorcycle."
sport,"[8] Others define naked bikes as equal in power and performance to sport bikes, merely absent the bodywork."
yamaha,[39] The Yamaha V-Max power cruiser.
sport,The same period that saw the naked and streetfighter variants of the sport bike theme also had a resurgence of the versatile standard in response to demand for a return of the Universal Japanese Motorcycle.
road,"[4][9] Supermoto-style street bikes, constructed with a completely different set of priorities than a road racing style sport bike, have also entered the mainstream, offering another option for riders seeking a spirited riding experience."
sport,"The nickname muscle bike has been applied to sport bikes that give engine output a disproportionate priority over braking, handling or aerodynamics, harking back to the Japanese superbikes of the 1970s."

motorcycle,[2] A meeting was held at the Soviet Defence Ministry to devise a motorcycle that would be suitable for the Red Army.
motorcycle,"The motorcycle was ""modeled after a late-1930s BMW sidecar bike called the R71, which Nazi Germany provided to the Soviet Union after the countries signed the nonaggression Molotov–Ribbentrop pact in 1939."
motorcycle,"""[3] According to official accounts, after lengthy discussion, the BMW R71 motorcycle was found to closely match the Red Army's requirements."
motorcycle,"Early in 1941, the prototypes of the Dnepr M-72 motorcycle were shown to Stalin who made the decision to enter mass production."
motorcycle,"As production escalated, the Moscow Motorcycle Plant was established, producing hundreds of Russian M-72 sidecar motorcycles."
motorcycle,"The decision was made to move the motorcycle plant east, out of bombing range and into the resource rich Ural mountain region."
motorcycle,"After WWII the factory was expanded, and in 1950 the 30,000th motorcycle was produced."
motorcycle,"In the late 1950s, the KMZ plant in Ukraine assumed the task of supplying the military, and the Irbit Motorcycle Works (IMZ) focused on making bikes for domestic consumers."
road,"(September 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Ural Gear Up Sahara Front view 2009 Ural ""T"" with sidecar, satin powder coat finish and red detail The main products today are the heavy duty Ural sidecar motorcycles with two-wheel-drive designed for rough, rugged terrain, and cT model for urban commuting and paved road touring."
engine,The company has developed an engine that meets the standards required by the modern sporting and leisure rider.
engine,"Though the outward appearance of the engine is the same as before, new quality control techniques employ better alloying and casting, better engineering tolerances, and better paint, powder coating and stainless steel exhausts while retaining the advantage of continuity with the inherently balanced design of a horizontally-opposed flat twin engine with roller bearings in a solid frame."
motorcycle,"Like most motorcycle manufacturers, Ural now sources pre-made components in many cases — buying alternators from Nippon Denso, brakes from Brembo, handlebar controls from Domino, forks from Paioli, ignitions from Ducati Energia, etc."
engine,"The company makes the frame, engine and body parts."
engine,The crankshaft had a longer stroke which increased engine capacity by 15% from 650 to 750 cc (40 to 46 cu in).
engine,"In 2007, Ural switched to a Ducati electronic ignition, and used new engine and transmission gears, designed by Herzog in Germany, providing a quieter engine and smoother-shifting transmission."
motorcycle,"[citation needed] Major changes were made to the motorcycle for the 2014 model year, including disc brakes on all three wheels, fuel injection and a hydraulic steering damper."

daimler,"[3][4][5] Daimler is often called ""the father of the motorcycle"" for this invention."
engine,"[6][7][8] Even when the three steam powered two wheelers that preceded the Reitwagen, the Michaux-Perreaux and Roper of 1867–1869, and the 1884 Copeland, are considered motorcycles, it remains nonetheless the first gasoline internal combustion motorcycle,[9][10][11] and the forerunner of all vehicles, land, sea and air, that use its overwhelmingly popular engine type."
motorcycle,[edit] The Reitwagen's status as the first motorcycle rests on whether the definition of motorcycle includes having an internal combustion engine.
motorcycle,"[1][11] If the outriggers are accepted as auxiliary stabilizers, they point to a deeper issue in bicycle and motorcycle dynamics, in that Daimler's testbed needed the training wheels because it did not employ the then well-understood principles of rake and trail."
motorcycle,"""[18] Cycle World's Technical Editor Kevin Cameron, however, maintains that steam power was a dead end and the Reitwagen was the first motorcycle because it hit upon the successful engine type, saying, ""History follows things that succeed, not things that fail."
daimler,Gottlieb Daimler visited Paris in 1861 and spent time observing the first internal combustion engine developed by Etienne Lenoir.
daimler,In 1872 Gottlieb Daimler had become the director of N.A.
engine,Otto & Cie the world's largest engine manufacturer.
engine,[22] Otto's company had created the first successful gaseous fuel engine in 1864 and in 1876 finally succeeded in creating a compressed charge gaseous petroleum engine due to the direction of Daimler and his plant engineer Wilhelm Maybach (Daimler's long time friend).
daimler,After some dispute over the direction design of the engines should take Daimler left Deutz and took Maybach with him.
engine,"This goal was achieved in 1883 with the development of their first engine, a horizontal cylinder engine that ran on Petroleum Naptha."
engine,Daimler's goal was to build an engine small enough that it could be used to power a wide range of transportation equipment with a minimum rotation speed of 600 rpm.
daimler,The next year Daimler and Maybach developed a vertical cylinder model which is called the Grandfather Clock engine and achieved 700 rpm and soon 900 rpm was achieved.
engine,"Having achieved the goals of producing a throttling engine with high enough RPM that was small enough to be used in transportation Daimler and Maybach built the 1884 engine into a two-wheeled test frame which was patented as the ""Petroleum Reitwagen"" (Petroleum Riding Car)."
engine,This test machine demonstrated the feasibility of a liquid petroleum engine which used a compressed fuel charge to power an automobile.
daimler,Daimler is often referred to as the Father of the Automobile.
motorcycle,"[25] ""The first motorcycle looks like an instrument of torture"", wrote Melissa Holbrook Pierson, describing a vehicle that was created along the way to Daimler's real goal, a four-wheeled car, and earning him credit as the inventor of the motorcycle ""malgré lui,"" in spite of himself."
daimler,[26] Daimler had founded an experimental workshop in the garden shed behind his house in Cannstatt near Stuttgart in 1882.
engine,[13] Daimler's and Maybach's next step was to install the engine in a test bed to prove the viability of their engine in a vehicle.
engine,"[13] Their goal was to learn what the engine could do, and not to create a motorcycle; it was just that the engine prototype was not yet powerful enough for a full size carriage."
engine,"[10][27] The Daimler-Maybach grandfather clock engine of 1885 The original design of 1884 used a belt drive, and twist grip on the handlebars which applied the brake when turned one way and tensioned the drive belt, applying power to the wheel, when turned the other way."
engine,"[33][34] It had a 264-cubic-centimetre (16.1 cu in) single-cylinder Otto cycle four-stroke engine mounted on rubber blocks, with two iron tread wooden wheels and a pair of spring-loaded outrigger wheels to help it remain upright."
engine,[13] Its engine output of 0.5 horsepower (0.37 kW) at 600 rpm gave it a speed of about 11 km/h (6.8 mph).
honda,"[27] Replicas[edit] The original Reitwagen was destroyed in the Cannstatt Fire that razed the Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft Seelberg-Cannstatt plant in 1903,[36] but several replicas exist in collections at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, the Deutsches Museum in Munich, the Honda Collection Hall at the Twin Ring Motegi facility in Japan,[37] the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in Ohio,[36] the Deeley Motorcycle Exhibition in Vancouver, Canada,[38] and in Melbourne, Australia."

sport,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Types of motorcycles Sport bikes, cruisers, scooters, and touring bikes are some of the many types of motorcycles."
sport,[2][3][4][5] Sometimes sport touring motorcycles are recognized as a seventh category.
motorcycle,"There are strict classification systems enforced by competitive motorcycle sport sanctioning bodies, or legal definitions of a motorcycle established by certain legal jurisdictions for motorcycle registration, emissions, road traffic safety rules or motorcyclist licensing."
standard,"[8] Contents 1 Street 1.1 Standard 1.2 Cruiser 1.3 Sport bike 1.4 Touring 1.4.1 Sport touring 1.5 Dual-sport 2 Off-road 3 Scooters, underbones and mopeds 4 Enclosed and feet forwards 5 Utility 6 Tricycles 7 See also 8 Notes Street[edit] Street motorcycles are motorcycles designed for being ridden on paved roads."
standard,"""The standard seemed to have disappeared..."" was part of a larger chain of thought."
sport,"[1] They are recognized primarily by their upright riding position, partway between the reclining rider posture of the cruisers and the forward leaning sport bikes."
engine,"[2] Because of their flexibility, lower costs, and moderate engine output, standards are particularly suited to motorcycle beginners."
standard,"[1] Standard is often a synonym for naked, a term that was used in reference to 1950s road racing bikes."
standard,"[9][10] The standard has seen a resurgence since the turn of the century, with ""modern classic"" motorcycles from Triumph, Ducati, Honda, Kawasaki and others."
motorcycle,"[3][4][6] Muscle bike is a nickname for a motorcycle type, derived from either a standard or sport bike design, that puts a disproportionately high priority on engine power."
standard,[1][11][12] Roadster is equivalent to standard or naked.
engine,"[1] Harley-Davidsons largely define the cruiser category, and large-displacement V-twin engines are the norm, although other engine configurations and small to medium displacements also exist."
motorcycle,"Related to the chopper motorcycle is the bobber which is created by ""bobbing"" a factory bike by removing dead weight and bodywork from a motorcycle to reduce mass and increase performance."
sport,"[16][17][18][19][20][21][14] Sport bike[edit] Main article: Sport bike A Suzuki GSX-R sport bike at Deals Gap Sport bikes emphasize top speed, acceleration, braking, handling and grip on paved roads,[3][5][22][23] typically at the expense of comfort and fuel economy in comparison to less specialized motorcycles."
sport,Sport bikes have comparatively high performance engines resting inside a lightweight frame.
sport,"Inline-four engines dominate the sport bike category, with V-twins having a significant presence, and nearly every other engine configuration appearing in small numbers at one time or another."
sport,"[1] Most sport bikes have fairings, often completely enclosing the engine, and windscreens that effectively deflect the air at very high speeds, or at least reduce overall drag."
sport,"[1] Sport bikes have high footpegs that position the legs closer to the body to improve ground clearance when cornering, and a long reach to the hand controls, which positions the body and center of gravity forward, above the fuel tank."
sport,"Streetfighters are derived from sport bikes, originally being customized sport bikes with the fairings removed and higher handlebars replacing the low clip-on handlebars."
sport,"[26] As with naked bike and muscle bike (below), the name streetfighter is used to help clarify the middle ground occupied by designs that blend elements of both sport bikes and standards."
motorcycle,"[27] Touring[edit] Main article: Touring motorcycle Honda Gold Wing GL1800 touring motorcycle Although any motorcycle can be equipped and used for touring, touring motorcycles are specifically designed to excel at covering long distances."
sport,[14][28][29][30] Sport touring[edit] A BMW R1100RS sport-touring motorcycle Sport touring motorcycles combine attributes of sport bikes and touring motorcycles.
sport,"The rider posture is less extreme than a sport bike, giving greater long-distance comfort."
sport,"[1] Accommodation for a passenger is superior to a sport bike as well, along with increased luggage capacity."
sport,"[1] Being lighter, at 550–720 lb (250–330 kg) wet,[14] than a pure touring bike and often having racier engines, suspensions, and brakes, sport tourers corner better and are more at home being aggressively ridden on curvy canyon roads."
sport,[1] The distinction between touring and sport touring is not always clear as some manufacturers will list the same bike in either category in different markets.
honda,"The Honda ST1300 Pan-European, for example, was listed by Honda as a sport touring motorcycle in the United States and Australia, but as a touring motorcycle in Europe."
motorcycle,"Dual-sport[edit] Main article: Dual-sport motorcycle BMW R1200GS dual-sport motorcycle Dual-sports, sometimes called dual-purpose or on/off-road motorcycles or adventure motorcycles, are street legal machines that are also designed to enter off-road situations."
motorcycle,"Supermoto motorcycles were designed to compete on a single course that alternated between three genres of motorcycle racing: road racing, track racing, and motocross."
motorcycle,This increasingly popular type of motorcycle is often a dual-sport that has been fitted by the manufacturer with smaller rims and road tires.
motorcycle,"and developed into a variety of off-road motorcycle sports, for which a number of specialized motorcycles have been built: Motocross — Such bikes are raced on short, closed off-road tracks with a variety of obstacles."
engine,"Engine capacities tend to be larger, usually between 450 cc and 750 cc."
road,"A dual-sport bike may resemble an enduro bike, but since a dual-sport bike is not intended to be used for competition, it may be less rugged, and equipped with dual-purpose tires and with more road legal equipment, such as indicators, mirrors and extra instruments."
racing,"Track racing — High-speed oval racing, typically with no brakes, nor rear suspension."
road,"[35] Scooters, underbones and mopeds[edit] Road racing a Lambretta scooter Main articles: Scooter (motorcycle), Underbone, and Moped Motor scooters are in many cases, classified as a separate vehicle to motorbikes, given their large amount of differences, and different evolution."
engine,"[36] Scooter engine sizes range smaller than motorcycles, 50–850 cc (3.1–51.9 cu in), and have all-enclosing bodywork that makes them cleaner and quieter than motorcycles, as well as having more built-in storage space."
engine,"They usually have the engine as part of the swingarm, so that their engines travel up and down with the suspension."
honda,"Modenas Kriss 120cc underbone Underbones are small-displacement motorcycles with a step-through frame, descendants of the original Honda Super Cub."
engine,"The moped used to be a hybrid of the bicycle and the motorcycle, equipped with a small engine (usually a small two-stroke engine up to 50 cc, but occasionally an electric motor) and a bicycle drivetrain, and motive power can be supplied by the engine, the rider, or both."
sport,There is also Sport mopeds – a type of moped that resembles a sport bike.
motorcycle,"Enclosed and feet forwards[edit] Zerotracer, winner of the Zero Emissions Race competition, is an electric feet forwards cabin motorcycle Enclosed motorcycles include cabin motorcycles and streamliner motorcycles."
yamaha,Tricycles[edit] Yamaha Niken with 3 wheels Main article: Motorized tricycle This section does not cite any sources.
yamaha,The Yamaha Niken is also a tilting three wheeler but has smaller track width such that it is considered a motorcycle by some authorities.

daimler,"Daimler and his lifelong business partner Wilhelm Maybach were two inventors whose goal was to create small, high-speed engines to be mounted in any kind of locomotion device."
engine,"In 1883 they designed a horizontal cylinder layout compressed charge liquid petroleum engine that fulfilled Daimler's desire for a high speed engine which could be throttled, making it useful in transportation applications."
engine,This engine was called Daimler's Dream.
engine,"[2] In 1885 they designed a vertical cylinder version of this engine which they subsequently fitted to a two-wheeler, the first internal combustion motorcycle which was named the Petroleum Reitwagen (Riding Car) and, in the next year, to a coach, and a boat."
daimler,Daimler called this engine the grandfather clock engine (Standuhr) because of its resemblance to a large pendulum clock.
daimler,"In 1890, they converted their partnership into a stock company Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG, in English—Daimler Motors Corporation)."
daimler,Daimler fell ill and took a break from the business.
daimler,In 1900 Daimler died and Wilhelm Maybach quit DMG in 1907.

daimler,"Gottlieb Wilhelm Daimler was the son of a baker named Johannes Däumler (Daimler) and his wife Frederika, from the town of Schorndorf near Stuttgart, Württemberg."
daimler,"After completing secondary school in 1848, Daimler had trained as a gunsmith under Master Gunsmith Hermann Raithel."
daimler,"[4] The same year, at eighteen, Daimler decided to take up mechanical engineering, abandoning gunsmithing,[4] and left his hometown."
daimler,"Daimler enrolled at Stuttgart's School for Advanced Training in the Industrial Arts, under the tutelage of Ferdinand von Steinbeis."
daimler,"Daimler was studious, even taking extra Sunday morning classes."
daimler,"[4] Daimler performed well, and when Rollé und Schwilque began making railway locomotives in 1856, Daimler, then 22, was named foreman."
daimler,"[4] Instead of staying, Daimler took two years at Stuttgart's Polytechnic Institute to hone his skills, gaining in-depth understanding of steam locomotives, as well as ""a profound conviction"" steam was destined to be superseded."
daimler,"[4] Career through 1882[edit] Daimler went to work for Maschinenfabrik Daniel Straub,[7] Geislingen an der Steige, where he designed tools, mills, and turbines."
daimler,"Otto and Cie[8] reorganized as Gasmotoren-Fabrik Deutz, management picked Daimler as factory manager, bypassing even Otto, and Daimler joined the company in August, bringing in Maybach as chief designer."
daimler,"[4]:482 While Daimler managed to improve production, the weakness in Otto's vertical piston design, coupled to Daimler's stubborn insistence on atmospheric engines, led the company to an impasse."
daimler,"[4]:482 Neither Otto nor Daimler would give way, and when Daimler was offered the choice of founding a Deutz branch in St. Petersburg or resigning, he resigned to set up shop in Cannstatt (financed by savings and shares in Deutz),[4]:482–483 where he was shortly joined by Maybach."
engine,"[4]:482 The Otto four-stroke engine (1876)[edit] In 1872 at age 38, Daimler and Maybach moved to work at the world's largest manufacturer of stationary engines at the time,[9] the Deutz-AG-Gasmotorenfabrik in Cologne."
daimler,"As directors, both Daimler and Otto focused on gas-engine development while Maybach was chief designer."
engine,"In 1876, Otto developed a gaseous fuel, compressed charge four-stroke cycle, (also known as the Otto Cycle) engine after 14 years of effort, a system characterized by four piston strokes (intake, compression, power, and exhaust)."
engine,"Otto intended that his invention would replace the steam engines predominant in those years, even though his engine was still primitive and inefficient."
engine,"Otto's engine was patented in 1877, but one of his 25 patents was soon challenged and overturned."
daimler,"Daimler hired an attorney who found that a ""previous art"" patent for a four stroke engine had been issued in Paris in 1862 to Beau De Rochas, a French public works engineer."
daimler,"Meanwhile, serious personal differences arose between Daimler and Otto, reportedly with Otto being jealous of Daimler, because of his university background and knowledge."
daimler,Daimler wanted to build small engines that could be applied to transportation but Otto had no interest in this.
daimler,When Otto excluded Daimler from his engine patents there was great animosity between the two.
daimler,"Daimler was fired in 1880, receiving 112,000 Gold marks in Deutz-AG shares in compensation for the patents of both Daimler and Maybach."
daimler,"1900 At Cannstatt, Daimler and the more creative thinking Maybach[4]:482 devised their engine."
daimler,"[4]:483 In the summer of 1882, Daimler moved to Cannstatt (just outside of Stuttgart at that time), purchasing a cottage in Cannstatt's Taubenheimstrasse, with 75,000 Gold marks from the compensation from Deutz-AG."
daimler,"[2] Daimler and Maybach spent long hours debating how best to fuel Otto's four-stroke design, and turned to a commonly available petroleum fraction."
engine,"""This is a combustion-efficient fuel - hexane N.""[13] The Dream engine 1883[edit] In late 1883, Daimler and Maybach patented the first of their engines fueled by ligroin."
engine,"This engine was patented on December 16, 1883."
daimler,"[14] Daimler had three engines built to this design early in 1884, and a flywheel was included in one of the engines."
daimler,"Daimler relied on hot tube ignition, until 1897, when he adopted the electrical ignition designed by Bosch."
motorcycle,"[14] The 1885 Grandfather clock engine[edit] The Reitwagen (riding car), the first internal combustion motorcycle (1885) The 1885 Grandfather Clock Engine The engine with the flywheel included was built into a light vehicle, called the Reitwagen, the first vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine."
daimler,"[4]:483 Daimler Motorcoach 1886 Daimler 1885 Engine in a boat Features of the 1885 Engine included: a single horizontal cylinder of 264 cc, 16 cu in[15] (58 mm × 100 mm, 2.3 in × 3.9 in)[15] air cooling large cast iron flywheel surface carburetor[16] hot tube ignition system (patent 28022) cam operated exhaust valves, allowing high speed operation 0.5 hp (370 W)[15] 600 rpm running speed, beating previous engines, which typically ran at about 120 to 180 rpm[17] weight of around 50 kg (110 lb)[15] height of 76 cm (30 in)[15] In 1885, they created a carburetor which mixed gasoline with air allowing its use as fuel."
daimler,"In the same year Daimler and Maybach assembled a larger version of their engine, still relatively compact, but now with a vertical cylinder of 100 cc displacement and an output of 1 hp at 600 rpm (patent DRP-28-022: ""non-cooled, heat insulated engine with unregulated hot-tube ignition"")."
daimler,"It was baptized the Standuhr (""grandfather clock""), because Daimler thought it resembled an old pendulum clock."
daimler,"In November 1885, Daimler installed a smaller version of this engine in a wooden two wheeler frame with two outrigger wheels, creating the first internal combustion motorcycle (Patent 36-423impff & Sohn ""Vehicle with gas or petroleum drive machine"")."
daimler,"First automobile 1886[edit] Independently of each other, Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler each produced an automobile in 1886, both in Germany, about 60 miles apart."
engine,"When this proved the engine capable of driving a vehicle, Daimler devised a 1.1 hp (0.82 kW; 1.1 PS) single and ordered a Wimpff und Söhne four-seater phaeton to house it."
engine,[4]:483 Daimler's engine was installed by Maschinenfabrik Esslingen and drove the rear wheels through a dual-ratio belt drive.
daimler,"[4]:483 On 8 March 1886, Daimler and Maybach secretly brought an American Model coach made by Wilhelm Wimpff and Sohn into the house, telling the neighbors it was a birthday gift for Mrs. Daimler."
engine,"Maybach supervised the installation of a larger 1.1 hp[15] 462 cc (28 cu in)[15] (70 mm × 120 mm, 2.8 in × 4.7 in)[15] version of the Grandfather Clock engine into this stagecoach and it became the first four-wheeled vehicle to reach 16 kilometres per hour (10 mph)."
engine,The engine power was transmitted by a set of belts.
road,"As with the motorcycle, it was tested on the road to Untertürkheim where nowadays the Mercedes-Benz Arena, formerly called the Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion, is situated."
engine,"Driven by Daimler's desire to use the engine as many ways as possible,[15] Daimler and Maybach used the engine in other types of transport including: on water (1886), by mounting it in a 4.5 m (15 ft) long boat and achieving a speed of 6 knots (11 km/h; 6.9 mph)."
engine,"The first customers expressed fear the petrol engine could explode, so Daimler hid the engine with a ceramic cover and told them it was ""oil-electrical""."
engine,"in the air in Daimler's balloon, usually regarded as the first airship, where it replaced a hand-operated engine designed by Dr. Friedrich Hermann Wölfert of Leipzig."
daimler,"With the new engine, Daimler successfully flew over Seelberg on 10 August 1888."
engine,"First Daimler-Maybach automobile built (1889)[edit] Steel Wheel Automobile 1889 · high speed four-stroke petrol engine · fuel vaporization · 2 cylinders V-configured · mushroom shaped valves · water-cooled · 4 speed toothed gearbox · pioneer axle-pivot steering system Engine sales increased, mostly for use in boats, and in June 1887, Daimler bought another property at Seelberg hill, Cannstatt."
daimler,Daimler managed the commercial issues while Maybach ran the engine design department.
daimler,"In 1889, Daimler and Maybach built the Stahlradwagen, their first automobile that did not involve adapting a horse-drawn carriage with their engine, but which was somewhat influenced by bicycle designs."
daimler,"Daimler Motors and the Phönix engine (1890 to 1900)[edit] Model of a DMG Lastwagen, 1896, first gasoline truck With demand for engines growing, for uses in everything from motorboats to railcars,[4]:483 Maybach and Daimler expanded."
daimler,"With funding from gunpowder maker Max Duttenhofer, industrialist, and banker Kilian von Steiner, and munitions manufacturer de:Wilhelm Lorenz, Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft was founded 28 November 1890, with Maybach as chief designer."
daimler,The three uses were expressed by Daimler in a sketch that became the basis for a logo with a three-pointed star.
daimler,"""Pact with the devil""[edit] From 1882 until 1890, Daimler had resisted making his company into an incorporation or stock company."
daimler,[19] Daimler hated having to incorporate his company.
engine,"The newcomers, not believing in automobile production, ordered the creation of additional stationary engine building capacity, and considered merging DMG with Otto's Deutz-AG."
daimler,Daimler and Maybach preferred plans to produce automobiles and reacted against Duttenhofer and Lorenz.
daimler,"[4]:483 Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft and First automobile sold (1890)[edit] In 1890 Daimler founded his own engine business, Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG)."
engine,"Its purpose was the construction of small, high speed engines they had developed based on the same stationary engine technology."
daimler,"[21] Returning from the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago with his new wife, Daimler had vowed to purchase enough shares of DMG to regain control."
daimler,Daimler sold all his shares and patents and resigned from the company.
daimler,"Daimler attempted to buy 102 extra shares to get a majority holding, but was forced out of his post as technical director."
daimler,The other directors threatened to declare bankruptcy if Daimler didn't sell them all his shares and all his personal patent rights from the previous thirty years.
daimler,"Daimler accepted the offer, receiving 66,666 Gold Marks, and resigned in 1893."
daimler,"In 1894 at the Hermann Hotel, Maybach together with Daimler and his son Paul designed a third engine called the ""Phoenix"" and had DMG make it."
engine,"It featured: four cylinders cast in one block arranged vertically and parallel camshaft operated exhaust valves a spray nozzle carburetor, patented by Maybach in 1893 an improved belt drive system This is probably the same internal-combustion engine referred to by the American author and historian Henry Brooks Adams, who describes the ""Daimler motor"" and its great speed from his visit to the 1900 Paris Exposition in his autobiography."

daimler,"In November 1885, Daimler installed a smaller version of the engine into a wooden bicycle, creating the first motorcycle (patent 36-423 – Vehicle with gas or petroleum engine), and Maybach drove it three kilometers from Cannstatt to Untertürkheim, reaching 12 km/h (7.5 mph)."
engine,"Maybach supervised the installation of an enlarged 1.5 hp Grandfather Clock engine into the coach, and installed a belt drive to the wheels."

daimler,"In June 1887, Daimler bought land in the Seelberg Hills of Cannstatt."
daimler,Daimler managed the commercial issues and Maybach the design department.

engine,"The ""Combat"" engine was released in January 1972 with a twin roller bearing crank, 10:1 compression and developing 65 bhp (48 kW) at 6,500 rpm."
engine,Older engines had used one ball-bearing main bearing and one roller bearing main bearing but the Combat engine featured two roller bearings in a mistaken belief that this would strengthen the bottom-end to cope with the higher power-output.
standard,This was superseded by a standard high capacity roller bearing early in 1973.
standard,"[31] The Commando was offered in several different styles: the standard street model, a pseudo-scrambler with upswept pipes and the Interstate, packaged as a tourer."
engine,"In April 1973 an 8.5:1 compression 828 cc ""850"" engine was released with German FAG SuperBlend bearings."
engine,"This model produced 51 bhp (38 kW) at 6,250 rpm but the stated power does not give a true picture of the engine performance because increased torque seemed to make up for the reduced horsepower."
engine,"However, as the Norton Villiers Triumph company was again in serious financial problems, development of the 'Wulf' was dropped in favour of the rotary Wankel type engine inherited from BSA."
engine,MidWest acquired the rights for light aviation use and at Staverton Airport the MidWest AE series was an aero engine developed from the twin-rotor engine.
racing,The new models succeeded in racing – winning the Senior TT in 1992 – but they moved rather more slowly in the commercial market.
motorcycle,The company had some success making the Wankel-engined Interpol 2 motorcycle for civilian and military police forces and the RAC.
racing,"This model was a de-tuned replica of Norton's RCW588 factory racing machines which won many short distance races, but had many reliability issues requiring frequent servicing i.e."
honda,"The team, headed by ex Honda-team manager Barry Symmons, Honda engineer Chris Mehew and chassis specialist Ron Williams, were tasked with producing a chassis that could be produced cheaply and an engine which would have a long term reliability."
engine,"However, in spite of many innovative solutions from Chris Mehew, the team's efforts to improve the reliability of the engine could not succeed to a commercially saleable level."
engine,The team quickly realized that placing an engine generating 1100 °C exhaust temperatures was not the item to place under a petrol tank.
motorcycle,Prof Blair commented that the Japanese had abandoned development of the motorcycle variant of the Wankel engine on two main counts: 1.
motorcycle,"As the team had realised, there was just too much heat to be confined in a motorcycle chassis."
engine,The pollution created by the engine burning both oil for lubrication and fuel for power was just too great to meet the impending pollution regulations without a large and expensive exhaust scrubbing system.
racing,"In his TV Series on British industry, Sir John Harvey-Jones commented that the company was governed more by heart than head and the Racing team were the only ones worth saving."
sport,It was reported in 2005 that a group of former Norton employees built nine F1 Sport models from existing stocks of parts.
sport,"[43] The Donington Park revival[edit] Norton Commando 961 Sport in 2009 During the late 1990s, Kenny Dreer of Oregon evolved from restoring and upgrading Commandos to producing whole machines."
racing,"After fifteen years of US ownership the Norton brand was secured by Stuart Garner, UK businessman and owner of Norton Racing Ltd. Garner established a new 15,000 sq ft (1,400 m2) Norton factory at Donington Park to develop the Dreer-based machine."
yamaha,"[44] The new Norton is a 961 cc (88 mm × 79 mm (3.5 in × 3.1 in)), air- and oil-cooled pushrod parallel twin with a gear-driven counterbalancer and a 270° crank (a concept pioneered on the Yamaha TRX850)."
motorcycle,[45][46] The new operation at Donington Park began limited production of a motorcycle based on the Kenny Dreer 961 Commando.
motorcycle,The new motorcycle only shared the outline of the Dreer bike; all aspects of the motorcycle were re-designed in order to move into production.

racing,"[32][33][34] NSU Sportmax streamlined motorcycle, 250 cc class winner of the 1955 Grand Prix season In the 1950s, streamlining began to play an increasing part in the development of racing motorcycles and the ""dustbin fairing"" held out the possibility of radical changes to motorcycle design."
motorcycle,"[35] NSU produced the most advanced design, but after the deaths of four NSU riders in the 1954–1956 seasons, they abandoned further development and quit Grand Prix motorcycle racing."
racing,"[37] The following year, 1958, full enclosure fairings were banned from racing by the FIM in the light of the safety concerns."
engine,"From the 1960s through the 1990s, small two-stroke motorcycles were popular worldwide, partly as a result of East German MZs Walter Kaaden's engine work in the 1950s."

yamaha,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Main article: Types of motorcycles Harley-Davidson Softail Heritage Classic Yamaha V-Max power cruiser A cruiser is a motorcycle in the style of American machines from the 1930s to the early 1960s, including those made by Harley-Davidson, Indian, Excelsior and Henderson."
motorcycle,"Japanese companies began producing models evocative of the early cruisers in the mid-1980s, and by 1997 the market had grown to nearly 60 percent of the US market,[1] such that a number of motorcycle manufacturers including BMW, Honda, Moto Guzzi, Yamaha, Suzuki, Triumph and Victory have currently or have had important models evocative of the American cruiser."
motorcycle,"[2][3][4][5] Cruisers are often the basis for custom motorcycle projects that result in a bike modified to suit the owner's ideals, and as such are a source of pride and accomplishment."
honda,"He estimates that Harley will take 52.5 percent of the cruiser market this year, down from 55 percent in 1991, and the four Japanese companies will combine for 47.3 percent, with Honda at 16.4 percent, Suzuki at 11.5, Kawasaki at 10.7 and Yamaha at 8.7."

motorcycle,"Others ride as a way to relieve stress and to ""clear their minds"" as described in Robert M. Pirsig's book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance."
motorcycle,"""[7] The connection to one's motorcycle is sensed further, as Pirsig explained, by the frequent need to maintain its mechanical operation."
motorcycle,[8] Speed appeal[edit] Speed draws many people to motorcycling because the power-to-weight ratio of even a low-power motorcycle is in league with that of an expensive sports car.
sport,The power-to-weight ratio of many modestly priced sport bikes is well beyond any mass-market automobile and rivals that of supercars for a fraction of the price.
yamaha,"Conversely, the fastest accelerating motorcycles meeting the same criteria is a much longer list and includes many non-sportbikes, such as the Triumph Tiger Explorer or Yamaha XT1200Z Super Ténéré, and includes many motorcycles dating back to the 1970s."
motorcycle,"Hunter S. Thompson's book Hell's Angels includes an ode to the joys of pushing a motorcycle to its limits, ""with the throttle screwed on there is only the barest margin, and no room at all for mistakes ... that's when the strange music starts ... fear becomes exhilaration [and the] only sounds are the wind and a dull roar floating back from the mufflers""[10] and T. E. Lawrence wrote of the ""lustfulness of moving swiftly"" and the ""pleasure of speeding on the road""."
motorcycle,"In New Zealand, motorcycle riders need not pay for parking that is controlled by a barrier arm;[16] the arm occupies less than the entire width of the lane, and the motorcyclist simply rides around it."
motorcycle,"Melbourne presents an example for the rest of the world with its free motorcycle footpath parking which is enshrined in their Future Melbourne Committee Road Safety Plan[18] On Washington State Ferries, the most-used vehicle ferry system in the United States, motorcycle riders get priority boarding, skip automobile waiting lines, and are charged a lower fare than automobiles."
motorcycle,"[21] Demographics[edit] A couple ride on a motorcycle in Udaipur, India Statistically, there is a large difference between the car-dominated developed nations, and the more populous developing countries where cars are less common than motorcycles."
motorcycle,"In developed nations, motorcycles are frequently owned in addition to a car, and thus used primarily for recreation or when traffic density means a motorcycle confers travel time or parking advantages as a mode of transport."
motorcycle,"In the developing world a motorcycle is more likely to be the primary mode of transport for its owner, and often the owner's family as well."
motorcycle,"[24][25] The four largest motorcycle markets in the world are all in Asia: China, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam."
motorcycle,"[24][25] As the middle class in India, China, and other developing countries grows, they are repeating the transition from motorcycles to cars that took place in the US in the years after World War I, and in Europe following World War II, and the role of motorcycling is changing from a transport necessity to a leisure activity, and the motorcycle is changing from a family's primary motor vehicle to a second or third vehicle."
motorcycle,The motorcycle is also popular in Brazil's frontier towns.
motorcycle,"[31] Amid the global economic downturn of 2008, the motorcycle market grew by 6.5%."
motorcycle,"[24][25][33][34] Usage in the developed world[edit] A Consumer Reports subscribers' survey of mainly United States motorcycle and scooter owners reported that they rode an average of only 1,000 miles (1,600 km) per year, 82% for recreation and 38% for commuting, adding to more than 100% because some riders rode for both recreation and commuting."
motorcycle,[37] Safety[edit] Main article: Motorcycle safety The relative risk of a motorcycle rider being killed or seriously injured per kilometre travelled was around 54 times higher in Great Britain in 2006 than for car drivers.
road,[40] The increased risk over other road users comes from the motorcyclist being relatively unprotected on the motorcycle.
motorcycle,"[41] To address motorcycle safety issues, motorcycle-specific training and personal protective equipment is important for motorcyclists' survival on the road, and mandated in many countries and several U.S. states and counties."
motorcycle,[citation needed] Causes for motorcycle accidents[edit] A Norwegian study has looked at the reasons behind motorcycle death accidents.
motorcycle,"[43] Technical problems with the motorcycle itself are rarely the cause of crashes, as this was shown to be a prominent factor in only 4% of the investigated accidents."
racing,"[44] Racing and supersport motorcycles, even while having the best handling capabilities, are overrepresented in fatal accidents."
racing,[46] More fatal accidents on racing motorcycles are caused by extreme behaviour than on touring motorcycles.
motorcycle,"[47] Helmet usage[edit] In Europe, head injuries lead to death in about 75% of fatal motorcycle accidents."
motorcycle,"They include commuters, mainstream motorcycle clubs such as long-distance riding clubs, adventure touring, trail riding and those involved with motorcycle sports, such as motocross riding, drag racing, circuit racing and trick or stunt enthusiasts; and those involved in customizing their vehicles in various different styles."
motorcycle,"[50] Numerous books about motorcycle subcultures have been written, including Hunter S. Thompson's Hells Angels, Lee Gutkind's Bike Fever, and Daniel R. Wolf's The Rebels."
motorcycle,"Clubs, lobbying groups, and outlaw gangs[edit] Motorcycle clubs[edit] See also: Motorcycle club A motorcycle club in Durban, South Africa Social motorcyclist organisations are popular and are sometimes organised geographically, focus on individual makes, or even specific models."
motorcycle,"Example motorcycle clubs include American Motorcyclist Association, Harley Owners Group and BMW MOA."
motorcycle,Some organisations hold large international motorcycle rallies in different parts of the world that are attended by many thousands of riders.
motorcycle,"Many social motorcycle organisations raise money for charities as a secondary activity, through organised events and rides, and others exist primarily as social benefit organisations, such as Bikers Against Child Abuse."
motorcycle,"One of the oldest such organisations, the British Motorcycle Action Group, was founded in 1973 specifically in response to helmet compulsion, introduced without public consultation."
motorcycle,"[53] Likewise, the U.S. has ABATE, which, like most such organisations, also works to improve motorcycle safety, as well as running the usual charity fund-raising events and rallies, often for motorcycle-related political interests."
motorcycle,"[54] Outlaw gangs[edit] Main article: Outlaw motorcycle club At the other end of the spectrum from the charitable organisations and the motorcycle rights activists are the ""outlaw motorcycle gangs."""
motorcycle,"One definition, by the Provincial Court of Manitoba, is: ""Any group of motorcycle enthusiasts who have voluntarily made a commitment to band together and abide by their organisations' rigorous rules enforced by violence, who engage in activities that bring them and their club into serious conflict with society and the law."
motorcycle,"""[55] The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Criminal Intelligence Service Canada have designated four MCs as Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs (OMGs), which are the Pagans, Hells Angels, Outlaws MC, and Bandidos,[56][57] known as the ""Big Four."""
motorcycle,[58] The motorcycle manufacturing industry and many government entities around the world have taken actions to clean up the reputation and activities of motorcyclists.

motorcycle,"(July 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Motorcyclists will refer to maintenance or repair of a motorcycle as wrenching in the US and ""spannering"" in the UK."
motorcycle,"A do it yourself self-sufficiency is said to be part of motorcycles' allure in an ""increasingly monolithic, unfixable world""[6] and being able to maintain one's own motorcycle is seen as part of the competency of being a motorcyclist."
motorcycle,"Historically, motorcycle maintenance was a necessary skill for riders, since the materials and technology used in motorcycles often meant that repairs had to be done on the road-side miles from home."
motorcycle,Modern motorcycles are as reliable as automobiles but many riders feel that their motorcycle is more than just a means of transportation which leads them to want to do maintenance on the motorcycles themselves.
