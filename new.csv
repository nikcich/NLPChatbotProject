a classic norton motorcycle 1952 lambretta 125 d scooter a motorcycle often called a motorbike bike or cycle is a two- or three-wheeled motor vehicle.
 motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel commuting cruising sport (including racing) and off-road riding.
motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being involved in other related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.
the 1885 daimler reitwagen made by gottlieb daimler and wilhelm maybach in germany was the first internal combustion petroleum-fueled motorcycle.
in 1894 hildebrand & wolfmüller became the first series production motorcycle.
 in 2014 the three top motorcycle producers globally by volume were honda (28%) yamaha (17%) (both from japan) and hero motocorp (india).
 in developing countries motorcycles are considered utilitarian due to lower prices and greater fuel economy.
of all the motorcycles in the world 58% are in the asia-pacific and southern and eastern asia regions excluding car-centric japan.
according to the us department of transportation the number of fatalities per vehicle mile traveled was 37 times higher for motorcycles than for cars.

there are three major types of motorcycle: street off-road and dual purpose.
within these types there are many sub-types of motorcycles for different purposes.
there is often a racing counterpart to each type such as road racing and street bikes or motocross including dirt bikes.
street bikes include cruisers sportbikes scooters and mopeds and many other types.
off-road motorcycles include many types designed for dirt-oriented racing classes such as motocross and are not street legal in most areas.
dual purpose machines like the dual-sport style are made to go off-road but include features to make them legal and comfortable on the street as well.

 this vehicle was unlike either the safety bicycles or the boneshaker bicycles of the era in that it had zero degrees of steering axis angle and no fork offset and thus did not use the principles of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics developed nearly 70 years earlier.
it was designed as an expedient testbed for their new engine rather than a true prototype vehicle.
 he exhibited his plans for the vehicle at the stanley cycle show in london in 1884. the vehicle was built by the merryweather fire engine company in greenwich in 1888.
 the butler petrol cycle was a three-wheeled vehicle with the rear wheel directly driven by a 5⁄8 hp (0.47 kw) 40 cc (2.4 cu in) displacement 2+1⁄4 in × 5 in (57 mm × 127 mm) bore × stroke flat twin four-stroke engine (with magneto ignition replaced by coil and battery) equipped with rotary valves and a float-fed carburettor (five years before maybach) and ackermann steering all of which were state of the art at the time.
the engine was liquid-cooled with a radiator over the rear driving wheel.
 many authorities have excluded steam powered electric motorcycles or diesel-powered two-wheelers from the definition of a 'motorcycle' and credit the daimler reitwagen as the world's first motorcycle.
 given the rapid rise in use of electric motorcycles worldwide defining only internal-combustion powered two-wheelers as 'motorcycles' is increasingly problematic.
the first (petroleum fueled) internal-combustion motorcycles like the german reitwagen were however also the first practical motorcycles.
 if a two-wheeled vehicle with steam propulsion is considered a motorcycle then the first motorcycles built seem to be the french michaux-perreaux steam velocipede which patent application was filled in december 1868 constructed around the same time as the american roper steam velocipede built by sylvester h. roper roxbury massachusetts.

 excelsior motor company originally a bicycle manufacturing company based in coventry england began production of their first motorcycle model in 1896. the first production motorcycle in the us was the orient-aster built by charles metz in 1898 at his factory in waltham massachusetts.
in the early period of motorcycle history many producers of bicycles adapted their designs to accommodate the new internal combustion engine.
as the engines became more powerful and designs outgrew the bicycle origins the number of motorcycle producers increased.
many of the nineteenth-century inventors who worked on early motorcycles often moved on to other inventions.
in 1898 triumph motorcycles in england began producing motorbikes and by 1903 it was producing over 500 bikes.
other british firms were royal enfield norton douglas motorcycles and birmingham small arms company who began motorbike production in 1899 1902 1907 and 1910 respectively.
by the outbreak of world war i the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world was indian producing over 20000 bikes per year.
 first world war[edit] triumph motorcycles model h mass-produced for the war effort and notable for its reliability during the first world war motorbike production was greatly ramped up for the war effort to supply effective communications with front line troops.
messengers on horses were replaced with despatch riders on motorcycles carrying messages performing reconnaissance and acting as a military police.
the british company triumph motorcycles sold more than 30000 of its triumph type h model to allied forces during the war.
with the rear wheel driven by a belt the model h was fitted with a 499 cc (30.5 cu in) air-cooled four-stroke single-cylinder engine.
[better source needed] the model h in particular is regarded by many as having been the first "modern motorcycle".
 introduced in 1915 it had a 550 cc side-valve four-stroke engine with a three-speed gearbox and belt transmission.
 postwar[edit] motorcycle rider on his rudge-whitworth motorbike australia ca.
1935 by 1920 harley-davidson was the largest manufacturer with their motorcycles being sold by dealers in 67 countries.
 amongst many british motorcycle manufacturers chater-lea with its twin-cylinder models followed by its large singles in the 1920s stood out.
initially using converted a woodmann-designed ohv blackburne engine it became the first 350 cc to exceed 100 mph (160 km/h) recording 100.81 mph (162.24 km/h) over the flying kilometre during april 1924.
 later chater-lea set a world record for the flying kilometre for 350 cc and 500 cc motorcycles at 102.9 mph (165.6 km/h) for the firm.
chater-lea produced variants of these world-beating sports models and became popular among racers at the isle of man tt.
today the firm is probably best remembered for its long-term contract to manufacture and supply aa patrol motorcycles and sidecars.
 nsu sportmax streamlined motorcycle 250 cc class winner of the 1955 grand prix season in the 1950s streamlining began to play an increasing part in the development of racing motorcycles and the "dustbin fairing" held out the possibility of radical changes to motorcycle design.
 nsu produced the most advanced design but after the deaths of four nsu riders in the 1954–1956 seasons they abandoned further development and quit grand prix motorcycle racing.
from the 1960s through the 1990s small two-stroke motorcycles were popular worldwide partly as a result of east german mzs walter kaaden's engine work in the 1950s.
 today[edit] royal enfield bullet in the 21st century the motorcycle industry is mainly dominated by indian and japanese motorcycle companies.
in addition to the large capacity motorcycles there is a large market in smaller capacity (less than 300 cc) motorcycles mostly concentrated in asian and african countries and produced in china and india.
 other major producers are bajaj and tvs motors.
 technical aspects[edit] a suzuki gs500 with a clearly visible frame painted silver construction[edit] see also: motorcycle components and motorcycle design motorcycle construction is the engineering manufacturing and assembly of components and systems for a motorcycle which results in the performance cost and aesthetics desired by the designer.
with some exceptions construction of modern mass-produced motorcycles has standardised on a steel or aluminium frame telescopic forks holding the front wheel and disc brakes.
a petrol-powered engine typically consisting of between one and four cylinders (and less commonly up to eight cylinders) coupled to a manual five- or six-speed sequential transmission drives the swingarm-mounted rear wheel by a chain driveshaft or belt.
the repair can be done using a motorcycle lift.
fuel economy[edit] motorcycle fuel economy varies greatly with engine displacement and riding style.
 due to low engine displacements (100–200 cc (6.1–12.2 cu in)) and high power-to-mass ratios motorcycles offer good fuel economy.
under conditions of fuel scarcity like 1950s britain and modern developing nations motorcycles claim large shares of the vehicle market.
in the united states the average motorcycle fuel economy is 44 miles per us gallon (19 km per liter).
 electric motorcycles[edit] main article: electric motorcycles and scooters very high fuel economy equivalents are often derived by electric motorcycles.
electric motorcycles are nearly silent zero-emission electric motor-driven vehicles.
reliability[edit] a 2013 survey of 4424 readers of the us consumer reports magazine collected reliability data on 4680 motorcycles purchased new from 2009 to 2012.
 the most common problem areas were accessories brakes electrical (including starters charging ignition) and fuel systems and the types of motorcycles with the greatest problems were touring off-road/dual sport sport-touring and cruisers.
 there were not enough sport bikes in the survey for a statistically significant conclusion though the data hinted at reliability as good as cruisers.
 these results may be partially explained by accessories including such equipment as fairings luggage and auxiliary lighting which are frequently added to touring adventure touring/dual sport and sport touring bikes.
 of the five brands with enough data to draw conclusions honda kawasaki and yamaha were statistically tied with 11 to 14% of those bikes in the survey experiencing major repairs.
 there were not enough triumph and suzuki motorcycles surveyed for a statistically sound conclusion though it appeared suzukis were as reliable as the other three japanese brands while triumphs were comparable to harley-davidson and bmw.
 three-fourths of the repairs in the survey cost less than us$200 and two-thirds of the motorcycles were repaired in less than two days.
 in spite of their relatively worse reliability in this survey harley-davidson and bmw owners showed the greatest owner satisfaction and three-fourths of them said they would buy the same bike again followed by 72% of honda owners and 60 to 63% of kawasaki and yamaha owners.
 dynamics[edit] racing motorcycles leaning in a turn main article: bicycle and motorcycle dynamics different types of motorcycles have different dynamics and these play a role in how a motorcycle performs in given conditions.
 motorcycle tyres have a large influence over handling.
motorcycles must be leaned in order to make turns.
this practice is counterintuitive and therefore often confusing to novices – and even many experienced motorcyclists.
 with such short wheelbase motorcycles can generate enough torque at the rear wheel and enough stopping force at the front wheel to lift the opposite wheel off the road.
accessories[edit] main article: motorcycle accessories various features and accessories may be attached to a motorcycle either as oem (factory-fitted) or aftermarket.
such accessories are selected by the owner to enhance the motorcycle's appearance safety performance or comfort and may include anything from mobile electronics to sidecars and trailers.
records[edit] the world record for the longest motorcycle jump was set in 2008 by robbie maddison with 107 metres (351 ft).
 since late 2010 the ack attack team has held the motorcycle land-speed record at 376.36 mph (605.69 km/h).
 safety[edit] motorcycle equipment main articles: motorcycle safety and motorcycle safety clothing wearing a motorcycle helmet reduces the risks of death or head injury in a motorcycle crash motorcycles have a higher rate of fatal accidents than automobiles or trucks and buses.
united states department of transportation data for 2005 from the fatality analysis reporting system show that for passenger cars 18.62 fatal crashes occur per 100000 registered vehicles.
for motorcycles this figure is higher at 75.19 per 100000 registered vehicles – four times higher than for cars.
 the same data shows that 1.56 fatalities occur per 100 million vehicle miles travelled for passenger cars whereas for motorcycles the figure is 43.47 which is 28 times higher than for cars (37 times more deaths per mile travelled in 2007).
 furthermore for motorcycles the accident rates have increased significantly since the end of the 1990s while the rates have dropped for passenger cars.
the most common configuration of motorcycle accidents in the united states is when a motorist pulls out or turns in front of a motorcyclist violating their right-of-way.
 this is sometimes called a smidsy an acronym formed from the motorists' common response of "sorry mate i didn't see you".
 motorcyclists can anticipate and avoid some of these crashes with proper training increasing their visibility to other traffic keeping to the speed limits and not consuming alcohol or other drugs before riding.
 the united kingdom has several organisations dedicated to improving motorcycle safety by providing advanced rider training beyond what is necessary to pass the basic motorcycle licence test.
these include the institute of advanced motorists (iam) and the royal society for the prevention of accidents (rospa).
along with increased personal safety riders with these advanced qualifications may benefit from reduced insurance costs young woman riding a motorcycle in laos with four young children passengers in south africa the think bike campaign is dedicated to increasing both motorcycle safety and the awareness of motorcycles on the country's roads.
it has dozens of trained marshals available for various events such as cycle races and is deeply involved in numerous other projects such as the annual motorcycle toy run.
 motorcycle safety education is offered throughout the united states by organisations ranging from state agencies to non-profit organisations to corporations.
most states use the courses designed by the motorcycle safety foundation (msf) while oregon and idaho developed their own.
an msf rider course for novices in ireland since 2010 in the uk and some australian jurisdictions such as victoria new south wales the australian capital territory tasmania and the northern territory it is compulsory to complete a basic rider training course before being issued a learners licence after which they can ride on public roads.
in canada motorcycle rider training is compulsory in quebec and manitoba only but all provinces and territories have graduated licence programs which place restrictions on new drivers until they have gained experience.
eligibility for a full motorcycle licence or endorsement for completing a motorcycle safety course varies by province.
without the motorcycle safety course the chance of getting insurance for the motorcycle is very low.
the canada safety council a non-profit safety organisation offers the gearing up program across canada and is endorsed by the motorcycle and moped industry council.
motorcycle rider postures[edit] bmw c1 with a more upright seating position bombardier can-am spyder showing location of rider on the trike the motorcyclist's riding position depends on rider body-geometry (anthropometry) combined with the geometry of the motorcycle itself.
 sport – the rider leans forward into the wind and the weight of the upper torso is supported by the rider's core at low speed and air pressure at high speed.
these are motorcycles that are not specialised to one task so they do not excel in any particular area.
 the standard posture is used with touring and commuting as well as dirt and dual-sport bikes and may offer advantages for beginners.
 cruiser – the rider sits at a lower seat height with the upper torso upright or leaning slightly rearward.
legs are extended forwards sometimes out of reach of the regular controls on cruiser pegs.
the emphasis is on comfort while compromising cornering ability because of low ground clearance and the greater likelihood of scraping foot pegs floor boards or other parts if turns are taken at the speeds other motorcycles can more readily accomplish.
 factors of a motorcycle's ergonomic geometry that determine the seating posture include the height angle and location of footpegs seat and handlebars.
legal definitions and restrictions[edit] main article: legal definition of motorcycle a motorcycle is broadly defined by law in most countries for the purposes of registration taxation and rider licensing as a powered two-wheel motor vehicle.
many jurisdictions include some forms of three-wheeled cars as motorcycles.
in nigeria motorcycles popularly referred to as okada have been subject of many controversies with regards to safety and security followed by restriction of movement in many states.
 environmental impact[edit] motorcycles and scooters' low fuel consumption has attracted interest in the united states from environmentalists and those affected by increased fuel prices.
 however a motorcycle's exhaust emissions may contain 10–20 times more oxides of nitrogen (nox) carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons than exhaust from a similar-year passenger car or suv.
 this is because many motorcycles lack a catalytic converter and the emission standard is much more permissive for motorcycles than for other vehicles.
 while catalytic converters have been installed in most gasoline-powered cars and trucks since 1975 in the united states they can present fitment and heat difficulties in motorcycle applications.
[better source needed] united states environmental protection agency 2007 certification result reports for all vehicles versus on highway motorcycles (which also includes scooters) the average certified emissions level for 12327 vehicles tested was 0.734. the average "nox+co end-of-useful-life-emissions" for 3863 motorcycles tested was 0.8531.
54% of the tested 2007-model motorcycles were equipped with a catalytic converter.
united states emissions limits[edit] the following table shows maximum acceptable legal emissions of the combination of hydrocarbons oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide for new motorcycles sold in the united states with 280 cc or greater piston displacement.
 tier model year hc+nox (g/km) co (g/km) tier 1 2006–2009 1.4 12.0 tier 2 2010 and later 0.8 12.0 the maximum acceptable legal emissions of hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide for new class i and ii motorcycles (50 cc–169 cc and 170 cc–279 cc respectively) sold in the united states are as follows: model year hc (g/km) co (g/km) 2006 and later 1.0 12.0 europe[edit] european emission standards for motorcycles are similar to those for cars.
 new motorcycles must meet euro 5 standards while cars must meet euro 6d-temp standards.
motorcycle emission controls are being updated and it has been proposed to update to euro 5+ in 2024.

sylvester roper who spent the u.s. civil war working in a union armory built a primitive "motorcycle" as early as 1867. roper's supporters -- and he has more than a few -- argue that he should be credited with building the world's first motorcycle.what gives credibility to daimler's claim of developing the first "true" motorcycle is the fact that it was gasoline-driven.
roper's post–civil war hog with a tiny two-cylinder engine was powered by steam.daimler's motorcycle was essentially a wooden bicycle frame (with foot pedals removed) powered by a one-cylinder otto-cycle engine.

be it a low-end bike or a high-end one all have the same potential to drive you crazy.
bikes have always given us precious moments; including some joyous rides cruising through the traffic snarl with ease and making all four-wheeler guys fume with fury (ah!
there is surely an emotional attachment for every bike owner and a story to narrate about his riding experience.
but we hardly give a thought to how these amazing man-made metal machines were created that are tirelessly serving us for years.
let's go back... the origin of motorbike the history of motorbikes drifts us back to the middle of 19th century when the bicycle was modified into a motorbike with a very few mechanisms that earned the name of a 'motorcycle'.
in 1885 gottelieb daimler and wilhelm maybach the german inventors created the first motorbike that sported a petrol-powered engine.
thought there are previous versions of the motorcycle that relied on steam power and charcoal.
the europeans devised many versions of the motorcycle and eventually motorcycle designing moved to america.
the first motorcycle that was sold for the common man was in 1894 developed by hildebrand and wolfmuller and since then there was no stopping as the bicycle makers started designing motorcycles.
in 1902 the bicycle maker triumph installed a belgian made engine and launched their first motorcycle and the following year harley davidson came up with their bikes.
when did india get its first bike?
motorbikes have become such an integral part of very average indian family so it is all the more intriguing to explore the history of bikes in the country.
the bike entered the indian arena rather very late and was launched out of necessity.
in 1955 the first ever motorbike was bought out by royal enfield company that was a 350cc-powered engine popularly known as bullet which arrived in india to aid the army and police officials for improving their patrolling duties.
the bike soon touched fame and popularity and many indian homes greeted the royal enfield bikes.
the bike scene gaining momentum motivated the escort motor company to launch their version called rajdoot that proved to more efficient and fulfilled most requirements of the middle-class indian families.
the followers  looking at the fast growing motorbike market in india the japanese two-wheeler icon yamaha launched their series of superior bikes for the indian consumer and was ranked the numero uno for almost a decade.
soon other foreign companies gauged the popularity of motorcycles in indian market and the immediate ascender was hero honda that featured bikes which were fuel-efficient and had no maintenance cost which raised the bike to fame in not time.
soon to follow the race were the indian companies bajaj motors and tvs motors who joined the celebration of bikes in the country.
and today india has variety of bikes; you name it and you have it.
there are most basic models to super bikes that cater to all class of people.
it definitely will not be an over-statement to say that india has a leading edge in this bike-race.

ama motorcycle museum hall of fame | george hendee  back advanced search first name starts withcontains last name starts withcontains     george hendee  inducted:  1998 co-founder of the indian motocycle company.
he was a successful bicycle racer who went on to excel in business and build the world's largest motorcycle company.
among the racers he sponsored was jacob de rosier a french-jewish immigrant who would go on to become one of the earliest stars of motorcycle racing.
through his involvement in bicycle racing hendee witnessed first-hand the excellent performance of the motorized pacing bicycle built by oscar hedstrom.
most pacing bikes of the era were crude and unreliable.
hedstrom's engineering ability helped him develop one of the best machines of its type and hendee quickly recognized hedstrom's talent.
hendee told hedstrom of his dream to mass-produce a motorized bicycle and asked hedstrom to build a prototype.
interest in the prototype from the press and potential customers encouraged the two men to form the hendee manufacturing company a partnership with hendee as president and general manager and hedstrom as chief engineer and designer.
hedstrom supervised the manufacturing of "motor bicycles" while hendee traveled extensively to set up dealerships and arrange financing for the company which grew at an astounding rate under hendee's management.
by 1912 the indian motocycle company as it was by then called was the world's largest motorcycle manufacturer and had moved into a vast five-story plant in springfield called the wigwam (below).
motorcycles once the most economical form of personal transportation were destined to be marketed as sporting or leisure vehicles and sales began to fall.
he had brought to fruition his dream of building a mass-production motorized bicycle he was wealthy and happily married and he decided to leave behind the burdens of running a large company for the life of a country gentleman on his farm in suffield connecticut.
hendee died in 1943 at the age of 76. he will be remembered as one of the fathers of motorcycling.

a a motorcycle reliability survey shows what goes wrong consumer reports news: march 26 2013 09:08 am find ratings motorcycles & scooters many factors can influence choosing a motorcycle but like cars chances are reliability will be a consideration.
after all the bike is more than a swagger statement.
it is some combination of transportation and recreation and therefore needs to be dependable.
the motorcycle reliability survey shows that among the bikes needing repairs accessories (21 percent) brakes (20 percent) electrical system (16 percent) and fuel system (15 percent) led all other problems by a substantial margin.
key to this is that we found that potentially expensive engine transmission and suspension problems were few.
the chart below details the frequency of problems cited by consumers who bought a motorcycle new from 2009 to 2012 and reported needing a repair.
none of these motorcycles were covered by an extended warranty or service contract purchased at an additional cost at the time of service.
which of the following parts on this motorcycle have been repaired?
percent accessories (e.g. lights meters switches radio) 21 brakes 20 electrical system (e.g. starting charging ignition) 16 fuel system (including fuel tank) 15 clutch 7 body panels/fairings/luggage 7 drive system (e.g. belt chain shaft) 5 wheels (not including tires) 4 exhaust system 4 cylinder head/valvetrain 3 exhaust system 4 crankcase/crankshaft/piston 3 transmission 3 front suspension 3 cooling system 3 rear suspension 2 steering/handlebars 2 frame/chassis 2 factoring in accessories (such as lights radio and other add-ons) and body panels (such as aerodynamic fairings and luggage) may help to explain why fully dressed touring bikes were less reliable than a more basic cruiser—there is simply more to go wrong or to get damaged.
see our full report on motorcycle reliability to see how reliability breaks down by bike type and brand in addition to owner satisfaction by brand.
the findings for this survey are based on 4424 reader responses regarding about 4700 motorcycles bought new from 2009 to 2012. the data was collected through the 2012 annual product reliability survey conducted by the consumer reports national research center.

i’ve got a friend who’s currently making her (bad-ass) way across country on a harley — 60 mpg baby — and we are both curious about the environmental impacts compared […] ask umbra® published may 29 2003 topic climate + culture share twitter facebook dear umbra i recently read a claim that “motorcycles produce far more pollution per mile than your typical car truck or suv.” is that true?
however and this is the word from california — where they actually care about car exhaust post signs in garages warning that carcinogens are present and have an entire government department devoted to breathing — anyway the word from california is that the cleanest 2004 motorcycle is eight to nine times dirtier than the dirtiest 2004 car.
put differently the best allowable california motorcycle is many times worse than the worst allowable california car.
the u.s. epa says the motorcycle hydrocarbon burden is 90 times higher than that of the typical passenger car and a motorcycle releases 20 times more total pollution per mile than a new car.
why is such a high-mileage engine so dirty?
well i’m glad you asked because it means: time to talk about the internal combustion engine!
our car engines are powered by endlessly repeating small explosions.
the energy from the explosion is used to move other parts of the engine such as pistons cranks rods reels hooks etc.
if an engine were perfectly efficient the only combustion byproducts would be carbon dioxide and water.
car engines have become cleaner over time through innovations (such as fuel injection) that allow fuel to burn more efficiently.
motorcycle manufacturers have been slow to add efficiency and catalytic converters to their engines but are working with regulators to clean up their acts.
trouble is anything that adds weight to the engine can impede its bad-ass performance.
motorcycle regulations are steadily improving and the feds are following california’s guidelines.
still to date motorcycles are bad bad bad.
on our other theme motorcycles are not safe.
here’s my horror story: a friend who thinks she’s driving her motorcycle defensively being careful etc. is on the interstate when the car in front of her brakes suddenly.
she rear-ends the car is thrown off her bike flies over the car she hit and then is run over by the car she hit and the car that used to be behind her.
amazingly enough she is alive and well and living in new york.

please call member services at 1-800-333-0663 we tested 5 electric bikes.
even the least expensive e-bike cr tested provides a speedy eco-friendly way to get around by lauren f. friedman  published december 13 2019 | updated september 22 2021  shares of the article  shares of the article one of our e-bike testers on the course.
but if you’re on an electric bike you can just relax: either the pedal assist will kick in automatically helping you to glide uphill or you’ll activate the throttle for a quick boost.
for many people “there are certain barriers to cycling: the distances are too far it takes too long it can be hard going up hills” says john macarthur principal investigator for electric bicycle research initiatives at the transportation research and education center at portland state university in oregon.
“once you put a battery onto a bike it breaks down a lot of those barriers.” it’s little wonder then that the popularity of electric bikes has soared.
(read about the new features on electric bikes from specialized.)
sales of e-bikes in the u.s. grew more than eightfold between 2014 and 2017 according to npd group a market research firm.
but the number of people in the u.s. who use e-bikes is still quite small—especially compared with the product’s massive popularity in china and parts of europe.
think an electric bike might be right for you?
here’s what you need to know if you’re thinking about buying an e-bike—including the safety considerations—along with details about our testing program and our findings.
find out whether an e-bike is right for you.
electric bikes: the basics before you buy an e-bike the first thing you should figure out is whether it’s legal to ride one where you live.
until recently the laws governing the use of e-bikes were different in almost every state says morgan lommele the director of state and local policy at people for bikes a bicycling industry group.
people for bikes has been lobbying state legislators across the country to enact uniform regulations governing the use of e-bikes.
more on cycling is an e-bike right for you?
best bike helmets of the year 4 biking safety tips for commuters the health benefits of biking to work bike helmets that don't meet safety standards are widely available next think about what you want to use an e-bike for and how far you’ll need it to go on a charge says bernie deitrick who leads cr’s electric bike testing.
on our hilly course the bikes we tested went between 15 and 30 miles before running out of juice—though that range is even wider when you look at the whole e-bike market and also varies depending on how and where you ride.
you should also keep in mind how a bike rides when it’s not charged—especially if you need to cover long distances or if you won’t always be able to charge it fully between rides.
compared with nonelectric bikes e-bikes tend to be heavy.
some of the bikes we tested were almost unrideable without the charged assist function while others made for a pleasant ride with or without a boost.
“you can have an e-bike that’s a great electric vehicle but a terrible bike” deitrick says.
you might have to try some e-bikes in person to figure out whether you’d prefer riding one with pedal assist (where the electric boost kicks in automatically as you pedal) or with a throttle (where you can get a boost by twisting or pushing a mechanism on the handlebars even if you’re not pedaling).
some e-bikes come with both pedal assist and a throttle.
if your local bike shop sells e-bikes—as many now do—give a few a test ride before you buy one deitrick recommends.
a shop can also help make sure a bike is properly fitted to your height and riding style.
some cities also have e-bike rentals or e-bike shares so you can see how you like e-bikes in general before deciding whether you might want to buy one.
one more thing to keep in mind: while a serious cyclist on a nonelectric racing bike can speed past a person on an e-bike on average people riding e-bikes go about 3 mph faster than someone on a traditional bike macarthur says.
if you’re buying or even renting an electric bike make sure you also get (and wear) a bike helmet that fits properly.
“the safety issues we see with bicycles we also see with e-bikes” lommele says.
“we’re still vulnerable users.” “cities are starting to get serious about building good infrastructure that’s safe and comfortable for [cyclists] to use” says christopher cherry ph.d. a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the university of tennessee knoxville.
how we tested for our tests all riders used each bike equally to average out any differences in performance due to weight riding level and style.
we did not evaluate the built-in computer that comes with many e-bikes—generally to track speed and distance—but we do mention which models have one.
range we fully charged the bikes’ batteries and then rode a hilly loop course on our test grounds at cr’s headquarters.
we maximized the assistance provided by the motors and the loop included stops and starts full-speed stretches u-turns a long uphill and a sharp downhill.
the score for this test is based on the number of miles each bike covered before the battery was depleted.
acceleration we timed the bikes on a set course starting from a standstill and accelerating to the highest speed.
hill climb we timed each bike as it climbed a short steep hill.
control response we judged how quickly each bike disengaged assistance when the rider stopped pedaling—an important safety feature.
the results of cr's electric bike tests we tested five models that included a variety of features at prices ranging from $600 to $2600.
we did not test any class 3 bikes which have top speeds of 28 mph.
these five models can’t be seen as representative of the entire electric bike market but they do provide a snapshot of the wide variety of e-bikes at the lower end of the market.
the e-bikes are presented in alphabetical order.
price: $1500 3 range 5 braking 4 acceleration 3 control response 4 hill climb 4 unassisted hill climb 5 unassisted cruising throttle: no computer speed/distance: noassist levels: 3 gears: 7 motor: hub seat type: cruiser saddle headlight: no battery amp-hours: 8.6 removable battery: yes cr's take: this cruiser-style pedal-assist bike has excellent braking and its rear derailleur makes for smooth comfortable riding.
these features make this bike a very good hill climber with or without the pedal assist turned on.
(a bike shop can generally add fenders and lights for an additional charge.)
though the electra’s makers say it’s designed to make it easy to hold the bike upright when stopped shorter riders should definitely try this one before buying because it has a relatively tall frame.
buy at: local bike shops jetson adventure price: $1300 3 range 4 braking 5 acceleration 2 control response 4 hill climb 5 unassisted hill climb 5 unassisted cruising throttle: no computer speed/distance: yesassist levels: 9 gears: 21 motor: hub seat type: sport headlight: yes battery amp-hours: 7.8 removable battery: no cr's take: this off-road style pedal-assist bike comes with front and rear derailleurs nine levels of assistance and 21 gears.
its small battery means the jetson looks the least like an electric bike among those we tested.
be prepared to ride with a forward-leaning posture on this narrow sport-style seat.
if you run out of power this is still a great versatile bike—the only one we tested that we earned excellent ratings in both unassisted hill climbing and unassisted cruising.
at about 40 pounds it was also the lightest e-bike we tested.
buy at: amazon / walmart / target / jetson nakto fashion price: $600 3 range 5 braking 4 acceleration 3 control response 2 hill climb 3 unassisted hill climb 1 unassisted cruising throttle: yes computer speed/distance: noassist levels: 1 gears: 21 motor: hub seat type: comfort saddle headlight: yes battery amp-hours: 10 removable battery: yes cr's take: the least expensive bike we tested by far the single-gear foldable nakto comes with one level of pedal assistance as well as a throttle.
while the other bikes we tested can go up to 20 mph this one tops out at 15.5 mph.
buy at: amazon / walmart radrunner electric utility bike price: $1300 4 range 4 braking 5 acceleration 3 control response 5 hill climb 1 unassisted hill climb 4 unassisted cruising throttle: yes computer speed/distance: noassist levels: 4 gears: 1 motor: hub seat type: flat headlight: yes battery amp-hours: 14.0 removable battery: yes cr's take: this low-to-the-ground bike has small (20-inch) knobby tires that are puncture-resistant.
the bike comes with a powered light a brake light and a kickstand and it’s easily customizable with add-ons such as a rear seat for passengers.
its upright position and small wheels take some getting used to but this bike handles well—as long as the e-assist is on.
without it this is a very poor single-speed bike.

the performance of this style of bike is contingent on choosing the correct gearing so be sure to switch to lower gears when accelerating or climbing hills.
the raleigh was the most expensive bike in our tests and also the only model that had hydraulic disc brakes which were more responsive (by a small margin) than any other braking system we evaluated.
overall this bike offers a comfortable relaxed ride—even when the battery runs out of juice—and it comes with fenders a computer and a cup holder (though no lights).

a a how to avoid motorcycle problems japanese bikes have fewer problems than bmw and harley models consumer reports magazine: may 2013 photo:  honda  find ratings motorcycles & scooters yes the artfully sculpted lines of a bmw motorcycle and the throaty rumble of a harley v-twin motor can stir your senses.
but they’re often accompanied by more problems than japanese motorcycles from honda kawasaki and yamaha.
those are the findings from our first motorcycle reliability survey conducted by the consumer reports national research center in which we asked subscribers to tell us about any serious problems or repairs they had experienced with their bikes in the previous four years.
as more people take up motorcycle riding whether to save gas or simply pursue a new or rekindled passion those new findings can help you avoid problems when you shop for one.
what your mechanic wants you to know motorcyclists could easily prevent many of the problems they encounter.
that’s the unvarnished message we got from motorcycle mechanics from around the country who discussed common problems they see in their shops.
"preventive maintenance is definitely the key to motorcycle longevity and keeping your maintenance cost down” says joe dane master harley-davidson mechanic at motorcycles of manchester in n.h. in addition to engine oil that includes changing brake fluid which can absorb moisture; lubing chains; aligning wheels steering heads and drive belts; and cleaning or changing air filters.
when tires are underinflated “handling gets really hard steering gets hard and the bike doesn’t want to lean” says mike franklin owner of mike’s garage in los angeles.
motorcycle brake pads cost as little as $50 says dane but once they’ve worn too far “you have to replace the rotors and everything else and the bill jumps up enormously.” franklin adds “when the [brake pads] get down to metal-on-metal they make an unholy grinding noise.
and yet people just continue to ride them.” inspect your bike regularly.
“really check your bike over before any long trip” dane says.
jon roppe chief harley-davidson instructor at the motorcycle maintenance institute in phoenix says “everybody wants their bike to look amazing but they tend to really lose the safety aspect.” store the bike properly.
motorcycle storage is a big issue.
“it’s the guys who let their bikes sit for weeks and months at a time that run into problems with failures” roppe says.
and if you can store your bike in a garage or under a cover out of the wind.

motorcycles and scooters can be an appealing and even economical alternative to a car for solo commuting running errands and more.
for some especially urban dwellers a two-wheeler may be the only transportation they need.
get up to speed on the best motorcycle or scooter we test evaluate and compare motorcycles and scooters for comfort acceleration and handling.
become a member what we found but motorcycles and scooters aren't for everybody.
passenger and cargo space is limited and riders are a lot more exposed to the dangers of harsh weather extreme temperatures poorly maintained roads and other motorists' errors.
the cold reality is that motorcyclists are 30 times more likely to die in a crash than people in a car according to the insurance institute for highway safety (iihs).
and 43 percent of all motorcycle deaths are the result of single-vehicle crashes.
speeding and alcohol continues to be major contributors to motorcycle crashes.
eliminate those factors and you've dramatically reduced your risk.
motorcycles can be a lot of fun and provide a more engaging travel experience than a car making you less isolated from your surroundings and more aware of the sights and scents of the world around you.
riding and maneuvering a bike is more physically demanding than driving a car and even getting a bike onto its center stand for parking a can pose a challenge for some.
(read our 10 motorcycle safety tips for new and returning riders.)
this guide is intended as a primer for new riders thinking about getting their first cycle and as a refresher for those who haven't ridden for a while but are thinking about getting back on a bike.
visit our motorcycle special section and see the owner satisfaction and reliability findings in the tabs above.
for more check our motorcycle & scooter ratings key things to consider we can't stress enough that riding isn't for everyone.
this is a high-risk mode of transportation best suited to coordinated adults with the ability to focus attention willingness to master the sport good vision and a healthy dose of common sense.
and don't think that if you are considering a scooter you are less exposed to danger than you'd be on a motorcycle.
scooter or motorcycle?
if you want a natural seating position rather than straddling an engine and to not be bothered with shifting gears the flat foot-rest floor and convenience of an automatic transmission define you as a scooter candidate.
it's easier to master a motorcycle if you already know how to drive a stick shift.
scooters and motorcycles can provide limited storage but they are not prime choices for transporting passengers or much cargo.
choosing a bike is often inspired by style and image but these really should be secondary considerations.
don't pick a bike that's larger than you can handle.
a standard rule is to choose a model that allows both your feet to be planted firmly on the ground when stopped and beginners should be careful not to choose a bike that's too powerful for their ability.
following this strategy will lead you to a bike that will be satisfying in the long term.
how can you possibly pick a bike you'd want to ride for years when you haven't even ridden for a week?
a garage is best but bikes can be parked outside and covered.
when parking outdoors you'll want a secure location and/or a means to lock the bike to prevent theft.
no license is required for scooters with engines less than 50 cc in most states.
you'll need to get a motorcycle license for anything larger than 50 cc which involves a written and a road test.
a list of licensing requirements can be found on the motorcycle safety foundation (msf) website.
many classes provide entry-level bikes giving a chance to not only learn but to sample bikes before buying one.
small fuel-efficient motorcycles begin around $4200 while larger and more fully equipped bikes can cost as much as a well-equipped sedan.
or you could just leave the bike in the elements and bring along a roll of paper towels when you want to go for a ride--a wet seat is never fun.
while fuel costs are usually less expensive for almost any cycle than they are for a car maintenance can be just as much depending on the bike how many miles you ride where you get it serviced and if you do some work yourself.
independent mechanics can be a more cost effective and bikes are generally easier to work on than cars if you choose to do some maintenance yourself as many owners do.
however you choose to do it motorcycles require oil changes and other service just like a car.
motorcycle satisfaction survey results types scooters and motorcycles run the gamut from lightweight fuel-sipping putt-putts to 200-hp pavement-ripping monsters with a wide variety of styles and performance levels in between.
beginners may find scooters more novice-friendly than motorcycles thanks to their lighter weight and automatic transmissions.
scooters can also make errand running easier because most have some on-board storage--something that can't be said for all motorcycles.
start by thinking about where and when you will ride and if you're looking for daily transportation weekend cruising or somewhere in between.
• does the bike need to have sufficient power and seating for a passenger?
to carry anything on a motorcycle you might want to consider saddlebags rear "trunk" or a rack usually mounted over the rear wheel behind the seat.
abs is commonly offered on large expensive models but it has been spreading to several entry-level sport bikes and midsized bikes adding at least $500 to the cost.
the insurance institute for highway safety (iihs) has reported that motorcycles equipped with antilock brakes are 37 percent less likely to be involved in a fatal crash than models without abs.
automatic transmission learning to ride a motorcycle is complicated by the myriad controls that have each foot and hand playing an active role.
• crash bars hoop-shaped bars mounted on the frame can help protect riders in a spill by keeping the weight of the bike off the rider's body.
motorcycles & scooters cruiser motorcycles with a relaxed riding position and seating for two cruisers combine the look of a traditional motorcycle with a more stylish custom appearance and typically longer wheelbase and forward foot pegs.
available in single and multi-cylinder designs cruisers run the gamut from small fuel-efficient models to big large-displacement bikes.
dual purpose motorcycles designed to be ridden on or off-road dual-purpose models can also be good choices for city dwellers who appreciate their higher ground clearance all purpose tires and extra suspension travel as much as trail riders do.
electric motorcycles electric motorcycles have been gaining in popularity especially with city dwellers who can appreciate their economical operating costs low maintenance and don't mind their limited range and top speed.
sport bike motorcycles with aggressive bodywork designed to slice the wind high-performance engines lightweight frames and a crouched riding position sport bikes are all about performance.
models span from affordable and fun 250 cc entry-level sport bikes up to exotic performance legends best suited for true expert riders.
touring motorcycles designed for long distance travel or day trips touring bikes are powerful and comfortable enough for two people to spend a full day in the saddle.
they can range from basic models with a minimum of frills to decked out bikes with saddlebags fairings windshields stereo and even cruise control and heated handgrips.
traditional/standard motorcycles these are the most well-rounded street motorcycles and the most conventional-looking designs with an upright riding position.
good for commuting and all-around use traditional models range in size from economical lightweight designs with around 250 cc engines to powerful models in the 1500 cc range.
small scooters (engines 50 cc or less) are also among the least expensive to buy with prices starting at about $1000.
all have automatic transmissions and electric start and they offer a more chair-like seating position than a motorcycle.
to see regulations by state check the msf website.
large scooters combining the seating position shift-free driving and on-board storage of a scooter with the highway capability and range of a cruising motorcycle large scooters (engines 400-650 cc) can be a good choice for travelers who prefer the look and feel of a scooter.
motorcycle & scooter ratings safety scooters and motorcycles require different skills to operate than cars and driving conditions that you might not give a second thought in your car can have serious consequences on a two-wheeler.
that's why professional instruction is a must especially for new riders or if you haven't been on a bike for a while.
a motorcycle dealer should be able to steer you in the right direction for local sources of training and the motorcycle safety foundation (msf) lists qualified instructional courses nationwide on its website.
more motorcycle safety tips can also be found on the national highway traffic safety administration website.
here are some factors to be aware of when making the switch from four to two wheels: be as visible as possible automobile drivers who have hit a scooter or motorcycle rider often say they didn't see the person.
when choosing a bike consider a colorful one.
in a turn sand wet leaves or pebbles can cause the bike to slide quickly and unexpectedly with potentially tragic results.
watch the road surface pavement irregularities that might be only an uncomfortable bump in a car can upset the balance of an unprepared bike rider.
railroad tracks for example should be approached at as close to a right angle as possible especially when they're wet so that the rails don't cause the bike's wheels to slide sideways.
the helmet should be a full-face design that's approved by the department of transportation.
the snell memorial foundation an independent helmet testing and standards-setting organization recommends replacing a helmet every five years or sooner if it's been damaged or has been in a crash.
maintenance like cars motorcycles and scooters require regular maintenance to keep them performing reliably.
the motorcycle safety foundation advises riders to check tire pressure and condition before each ride as part of a safety inspection that also includes controls cables hoses wheels brakes lights drive chain suspension and even the frame.
